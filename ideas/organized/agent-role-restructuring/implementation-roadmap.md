# Agent Restructuring Implementation Roadmap

## Phase 1: Proof of Concept (Weeks 1-2)

### Week 1: Analytics Engineer Role
**Why Start Here**: Most immediate value - reduces dbt/Snowflake/Tableau coordination by 60%

**Day 1-2: Agent Creation**
```bash
# Create the agent file
cp .claude/agents/agent-template.md .claude/agents/analytics-engineer-role.md

# Core capabilities to integrate:
- dbt-expert: Model development, testing, documentation
- snowflake-expert: SQL optimization, warehouse features
- tableau-expert: Data source optimization, semantic layer
```

**Day 3-4: Testing Framework**
- Test scenarios from recent projects
- Measure: Response time, handoffs, accuracy
- Compare: Same task with tool-based vs role-based

**Day 5: Validation**
- Real project test: "Optimize slow dashboard"
- Success criteria: 40% faster resolution

### Week 2: Data Engineer Role
**Why Second**: Unifies fragmented ingestion story

**Day 1-2: Agent Creation**
```bash
# Create the agent file
cp .claude/agents/agent-template.md .claude/agents/data-engineer-role.md

# Core capabilities to integrate:
- dlthub-expert: Batch ingestion patterns
- orchestra-expert: Workflow orchestration
- prefect-expert: Stream processing
- Infrastructure awareness
```

**Day 3-4: Integration Testing**
- Test: "Set up customer data pipeline"
- Measure: Single agent vs three tool agents
- Validate: Both batch and streaming scenarios

**Day 5: Refinement**
- Adjust boundaries with analytics-engineer-role
- Document handoff protocols

## Phase 2: Parallel Running (Weeks 3-4)

### Week 3: Side-by-Side Comparison
**Objective**: Quantify improvements with real work

**Test Protocol**:
1. Each new task attempted both ways
2. Track metrics:
   - Time to resolution
   - Number of agent invocations
   - Context switches
   - User satisfaction

**Expected Results**:
```
| Task Type | Tool-Based | Role-Based | Improvement |
|-----------|------------|------------|-------------|
| Data modeling | 90 min | 45 min | 50% |
| Pipeline setup | 120 min | 60 min | 50% |
| Debug data issue | 180 min | 60 min | 66% |
| Performance optimization | 240 min | 90 min | 62% |
```

### Week 4: Expand Role Coverage
**Additional Roles to Create**:

**BI Developer Role**
```bash
# Combines:
- tableau-expert (visualization layer)
- ui-ux-expert (user experience)
- documentation-expert (end-user docs)
```

**Platform Engineer Role**
```bash
# Combines:
- Infrastructure management
- Security and access control
- Cost optimization
- Monitoring and alerting
```

## Phase 3: Optimization (Weeks 5-6)

### Week 5: Refine Boundaries
**Key Decisions**:
1. **Handoff Points**: Clear protocols between roles
2. **Specialist Escalation**: When to invoke tool experts
3. **Knowledge Sharing**: How roles share context

**Boundary Examples**:
```yaml
data-engineer → analytics-engineer:
  trigger: "Raw data landed in staging"
  context_passed: [table_names, load_timestamps, data_volumes]

analytics-engineer → bi-developer:
  trigger: "Mart models deployed"
  context_passed: [model_names, business_logic, metric_definitions]
```

### Week 6: Create Specialist Libraries
**Transform tool agents to knowledge libraries**:

```python
# Instead of invoking agents:
old_way = "Let me ask dbt-expert about incremental strategies"

# Reference knowledge directly:
new_way = "Consulting dbt patterns library for incremental strategies"
```

**Benefits**:
- Faster consultation (no agent overhead)
- Consistent knowledge access
- Easier to update and maintain

## Phase 4: Full Migration (Weeks 7-8)

### Week 7: Team Training & Documentation
**Documentation Updates**:
1. Update CLAUDE.md with new role structure
2. Create role interaction diagrams
3. Document common workflows
4. Update project templates

**Team Enablement**:
```markdown
## Quick Reference Card

**For Data Problems**: Start with data-engineer-role
**For Transformation**: Start with analytics-engineer-role
**For Dashboards**: Start with bi-developer-role
**For Architecture**: Start with data-architect-role
```

### Week 8: Sunset Tool-Based Agents
**Gradual Deprecation**:
1. Move tool agents to `.claude/agents/deprecated/`
2. Convert to reference libraries in `.claude/knowledge/tools/`
3. Update all workflow documentation
4. Archive but don't delete (historical reference)

## Success Metrics & Checkpoints

### Week 2 Checkpoint
- [ ] Analytics engineer role handles 80% of transformation tasks independently
- [ ] 40% reduction in coordination overhead demonstrated
- [ ] Data engineer role successfully manages full pipeline

### Week 4 Checkpoint
- [ ] All major roles defined and tested
- [ ] 50% average efficiency gain across all task types
- [ ] Clear boundary definitions established

### Week 6 Checkpoint
- [ ] Specialist knowledge libraries created
- [ ] Handoff protocols optimized
- [ ] Team feedback incorporated

### Week 8 - Go/No-Go Decision
**Success Criteria for Full Migration**:
- ✅ 40%+ efficiency gain sustained
- ✅ 90% task coverage without tool agents
- ✅ Positive team feedback
- ✅ No critical gaps identified

**If Successful**: Complete migration
**If Not**: Maintain hybrid with refinements

## Risk Management

### Risk 1: Knowledge Gaps
**Mitigation**: Keep tool experts available for consultation during transition

### Risk 2: Boundary Confusion
**Mitigation**: Clear RACI matrix for each role

### Risk 3: Over-broad Agents
**Mitigation**: Strict scope limits based on data lifecycle stages

### Risk 4: Team Resistance
**Mitigation**: Gradual rollout with continuous feedback

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Week 1: Create first role-based agent
./scripts/capture.sh "Create analytics-engineer-role agent"
./scripts/build.sh analytics-engineer-role-agent

# Week 2: Create data engineer role
./scripts/capture.sh "Create data-engineer-role agent"
./scripts/build.sh data-engineer-role-agent

# Week 3: Run parallel tests
./scripts/capture.sh "Test role-based agents in parallel"
./scripts/roadmap.sh sprint

# Week 8: Migration completion
./scripts/capture.sh "Complete agent migration to role-based"
./scripts/finish.sh agent-role-migration
```

## Long-term Vision

### 6 Months Out
- Fully role-based agent architecture
- 50% reduction in task completion time
- Industry-leading AI-assisted analytics workflow
- Expandable to new tools without new agents

### 12 Months Out
- Self-improving roles through usage patterns
- Cross-organization knowledge sharing
- Template for other teams adopting AI assistance
- Published framework for role-based agent design

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a low-risk, measured approach to migrating from tool-based to role-based agents. Starting with the highest-value role (analytics engineer) allows for quick validation while maintaining the ability to rollback if needed.

The key success factor is that this aligns with how data teams actually work, making the AI assistance feel natural rather than forced into artificial tool boundaries.
