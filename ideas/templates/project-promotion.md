## Promotion Decision Matrix

### ✅ Ready for Promotion
**All critical items checked AND:**
- Clear problem and solution
- Technical feasibility confirmed
- Resources available
- Stakeholder alignment
- Measurable success criteria

### ⚠️ Needs Development Before Promotion
**Some items missing - address before promoting:**
- [ ] **Research needed**: [Specific investigation required]
- [ ] **Stakeholder input**: [Who needs to be consulted]
- [ ] **Technical spike**: [Proof of concept or investigation needed]
- [ ] **Resource planning**: [Capacity or skill planning needed]
- [ ] **Scope refinement**: [Boundaries need clarification]

### ❌ Not Ready for Promotion
**Major gaps that require significant work:**
- [ ] **Fundamental feasibility questions**
- [ ] **Significant resource constraints**
- [ ] **Lack of stakeholder support**
- [ ] **Unclear business value**
- [ ] **Major technical unknowns**

## Post-Promotion Setup

### Project Structure Validation
- [ ] **Project type correctly identified** (feature/fix/research/refactor/docs)
- [ ] **Project name is descriptive and searchable**
- [ ] **Git branch created with appropriate naming**

### Specification Enhancement
- [ ] **Original idea context preserved** (links back to organized ideas)
- [ ] **Implementation plan detailed** (phases, tasks, timeline)
- [ ] **Technical requirements specified** (systems, tools, dependencies)
- [ ] **Success criteria elaborated** (detailed acceptance criteria)

### Team Coordination
- [ ] **Specialist agents identified** (dbt-expert, snowflake-expert, etc.)
- [ ] **Task assignments clarified** (who does what)
- [ ] **Communication plan established** (updates, reviews, blockers)

### Integration Points
- [ ] **Links maintained to original ideation**
- [ ] **Quarterly planning alignment confirmed**
- [ ] **ClickUp boundaries respected** (technical details stay local)

## Common Promotion Patterns

### Quick Win Projects (1-2 weeks)
- ✅ Well-defined scope
- ✅ Minimal dependencies
- ✅ Clear technical approach
- ✅ Single domain focus

### Strategic Projects (4-8 weeks)
- ✅ Multi-phase implementation
- ✅ Cross-system integration
- ✅ Specialist agent coordination
- ✅ Stakeholder communication plan

### Research Projects (2-4 weeks)
- ✅ Investigative scope
- ✅ Learning objectives defined
- ✅ Success criteria for research
- ✅ Decision framework for next steps

### Platform/Infrastructure Projects (6-12 weeks)
- ✅ Architectural impact assessment
- ✅ Migration planning
- ✅ Risk mitigation strategies
- ✅ Rollback procedures

## Red Flags - Delay Promotion

⚠️ **"We'll figure it out as we go"** - Scope too vague
⚠️ **"Should be quick and easy"** - Complexity underestimated
⚠️ **"Everyone wants this"** - No specific stakeholder identified
⚠️ **"Similar to what we did before"** - Assuming false equivalence
⚠️ **"Just a small change"** - Impact not fully assessed

## Promotion Success Indicators

✅ **Team excited about the project** - Clear value proposition
✅ **Realistic timeline** - Effort estimation based on analysis
✅ **Clear next steps** - Implementation path is obvious
✅ **Stakeholder buy-in** - Support for resource allocation
✅ **Measurable outcomes** - Success criteria are specific
