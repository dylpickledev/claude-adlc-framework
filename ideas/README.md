# D&A Idea Management System

## Overview
The D&A Idea Management System is a "spaghetti organizer" that helps the team capture raw brainstorming ideas and transform them into structured, actionable projects using AI-powered organization.

## Directory Structure

```
ideas/
├── inbox/           # Raw idea capture (unsorted)
├── organized/       # AI-clustered and structured ideas
├── quarterly/       # Quarterly planning sessions
├── pipeline/        # Ideas ready for project conversion
├── archive/         # Completed or rejected ideas
└── templates/       # Idea templates and formats
```

## Workflow

### 1. **Rapid Idea Capture**
```bash
claude /ideate "Implement real-time data quality monitoring dashboard"
```
- Brain-dump concepts in under 30 seconds
- No structure required, just capture the core idea
- Ideas stored in `ideas/inbox/` with timestamps

### 2. **AI Organization**
```bash
claude /organize
```
- Claude analyzes all inbox ideas
- Clusters related concepts into themes
- Structures ideas with context and potential impact
- Results stored in `ideas/organized/`

### 3. **Quarterly Planning**
```bash
claude /quarterly Q2-2025
```
- Facilitate strategic planning sessions
- Create roadmaps with priorities and dependencies
- Generate quarterly goals and milestones
- Output stored in `ideas/quarterly/`

### 4. **Project Promotion**
```bash
claude /promote data-quality-monitoring
```
- Transition organized ideas to active projects
- Creates project spec in `projects/active/`
- Links back to original idea for context
- Moves idea to `ideas/pipeline/`

### 5. **ClickUp Export**
```bash
claude /export-clickup quarterly Q2-2025
```
- Export strategic roadmaps for stakeholder sharing
- Generate ClickUp-ready summaries
- Maintain links between systems

## Granularity Rules

### Keep Local (da-agent-hub)
- **Technical spikes** and proof-of-concepts
- **Detailed project execution** (models, code, testing)
- **Agent coordination** and technical findings
- **Knowledge preservation** and learning documentation

### Export to ClickUp
- **Strategic initiatives** requiring executive visibility
- **Cross-departmental projects** involving other teams
- **Budget requests** and resource allocation decisions
- **Stakeholder communication** and milestone tracking

## Best Practices

### Idea Capture
- **Be specific but brief**: "ML-powered customer churn prediction" vs "do ML stuff"
- **Include context**: What problem does this solve?
- **Don't self-censor**: Capture everything, let AI organize later
- **Use consistent timing**: Capture ideas right after meetings/brainstorms

### Organization Sessions
- **Run weekly**: Keep inbox from getting overwhelming
- **Review themes**: Look for patterns across ideas
- **Validate with team**: AI suggestions should make sense to humans
- **Document decisions**: Why certain ideas were prioritized or rejected

### Project Promotion
- **Ensure readiness**: Idea should be well-defined before promotion
- **Check resources**: Do we have capacity for this project?
- **Link dependencies**: How does this relate to other work?
- **Set success criteria**: What does "done" look like?

## Templates Available

- `templates/idea-template.md` - Standard idea capture format
- `templates/quarterly-planning.md` - Planning session structure
- `templates/clickup-export.md` - Export format for stakeholders
- `templates/project-promotion.md` - Transition checklist

## Integration Points

- **Existing Projects**: Seamless transition via `/start_project`
- **Specialist Agents**: Technical analysis from dbt-expert, snowflake-expert, etc.
- **Git Workflow**: Full version control for idea evolution
- **ClickUp Sync**: Strategic roadmap sharing without workflow disruption
