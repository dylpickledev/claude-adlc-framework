## 🏗️ MCP Architecture Status (Week 1 COMPLETE ✅)

The DA Agent Hub is undergoing a **12-week transformation** to integrate Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers with specialist agents for data-driven, expert-validated decision-making.

### ✅ Week 1: Foundation & Testing (COMPLETE)

**MCP Servers Operational (8/8 - 100%)**
- ✅ **dbt-mcp**: Transformation layer access
- ✅ **snowflake-mcp**: Data warehouse operations
- ✅ **aws-api**: AWS infrastructure management
- ✅ **aws-docs**: AWS documentation search
- ✅ **github**: Repository operations
- ✅ **slack**: Team communication
- ✅ **filesystem**: Local file access
- ✅ **sequential-thinking**: Complex reasoning

**Specialists Operational (4)**
- ✅ **aws-expert**: AWS infrastructure (aws-api + aws-docs + aws-knowledge MCP)
- ✅ **dbt-expert**: SQL transformations (dbt-mcp + snowflake-mcp + github-mcp)
- ✅ **snowflake-expert**: Warehouse optimization (snowflake-mcp + dbt-mcp)
- ✅ **github-sleuth-expert**: Issue investigation (github-mcp + context resolution)

**Key Achievements**
- ✅ All MCP servers authenticated via 1Password
- ✅ Smart repository context resolution (13+ repos)
- ✅ GitHub Sleuth Expert revived with MCP integration
- ✅ Comprehensive testing and validation complete
- ✅ Pattern documentation for future specialists

**Architecture Pattern**
```
Role Agent (primary)
    ↓ Delegates when confidence <0.60 OR expertise needed
Specialist (expert)
    ├─ Uses MCP tools (data access)
    ├─ Applies domain expertise (synthesis, validation)
    └─ Returns validated recommendation
Role Agent
    └─ Executes with confidence
```

**See**: Issue #88 for complete 12-week transformation roadmap

## 🚀 Quick Start: 4 Simple Commands

**Never used this before? Here's how to go from idea to production:**

### 1️⃣ **Capture Ideas** → `/capture "your idea"`
Brainstorming with your team? Just throw ideas at Claude and they get saved automatically:
```bash
claude /capture "We need a real-time sales dashboard"
```
*That's it. No forms, no tickets. When you've captured 3+ ideas, Claude auto-organizes them into themes.*

### 2️⃣ **Plan Your Quarter** → `/roadmap quarterly`
Need to prioritize? Get an impact vs. effort analysis:
```bash
claude /roadmap quarterly
```
*Claude creates a strategic plan showing which ideas give you the biggest bang for your buck.*

### 3️⃣ **Build Something** → `/build "idea-name"`
Ready to execute? Turn your idea into a full project structure:
```bash
claude /build "real-time-sales-dashboard"
```
*Creates a complete project folder with AI agents ready to help build it. Sets up git branches, coordinates specialists, the whole nine yards.*

### 4️⃣ **Ship It** → `/complete "project-name"`
Done building? Archive the project and clean up:
```bash
claude /complete "feature-real-time-sales-dashboard"
```
*Handles git workflow, archives documentation, updates related ideas. Everything gets documented for the next person.*

**That's the entire workflow.** Four commands that handle everything from "shower thought" to "running in production."

### 💡 Optional: Better Context Switching
Working on multiple projects? Set up isolated VS Code workspaces:
```bash
claude /setup-worktrees
```
*One-time setup. Now each `/build` creates a dedicated VS Code window with zero context contamination.*
