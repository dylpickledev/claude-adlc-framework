## üåü Overview

The DA Agent Hub serves **two complementary purposes** for modern data teams:

### üîß **Local Development Agent Hub**
A Claude Code CLI system with specialized sub-agents (dbt-expert, snowflake-expert, tableau-expert) that help you develop, debug, and optimize your data infrastructure locally.

### ü§ñ **Automated GitHub Workflows**
A complete automated system that monitors your dbt Cloud projects for errors, creates GitHub issues with detailed context, and uses Claude AI to investigate and propose fixes through interactive collaboration.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### üîß **Local Development Setup**
**For developers who want AI-powered assistance while developing locally**

1. **Clone and setup**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/graniterock/da-agent-hub.git
   cd da-agent-hub
   ./setup.sh
   ```

2. **Start using agents**:
   ```bash
   claude "analyze my dbt models using dbt-expert"
   claude "optimize this Snowflake query with snowflake-expert"
   ```

**Prerequisites**: Claude Code CLI, GitHub CLI, your data repositories

### ü§ñ **Automated Operations Setup**
**For teams who want automated monitoring and AI-powered issue resolution**

1. **Configure secrets** in your dbt repository:
   ```bash
   DBT_CLOUD_API_TOKEN=your_token
   DBT_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID=your_id
   GITHUB_API_TOKEN=your_github_token
   ```

2. **Deploy monitoring workflow** to your dbt project (`.github/workflows/dbt-error-monitor.yml`)

3. **Configure da-agent-hub secrets**:
   ```bash
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_claude_oauth_token
   ```

**Prerequisites**: GitHub repository, dbt Cloud account, Claude Pro/Max subscription

## üéÆ Usage Examples

### üîß **Local Development**
```bash
# Basic agent consultation
claude "coordinate dbt-expert and snowflake-expert to solve this performance issue"

# Project workflows
/start_project
claude --agent dbt-expert "investigate model dependencies"
```

### ü§ñ **Automated Operations**
```bash
# Comment on any GitHub issue
@claude create PR to resolve this unique constraint issue
@claude investigate the upstream data quality for this model

# Assign issues to claude[bot] for auto-fixing
# Add labels: claude:fix, claude:investigate, claude:collaborate
```
