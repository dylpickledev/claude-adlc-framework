# /build Command Protocol

## Purpose
Execute highest priority ideas as complete projects. Implements ADLC Develop + Test + Deploy phases with specialist agent coordination and full project management integration.

## Usage
```bash
claude /build [idea-name]
```

## Protocol

### 1. Execute build.sh Script
```bash
./scripts/build.sh [idea-name]
```

### 2. Complete Project Creation Workflow
- **Finds organized ideas**: Searches `ideas/organized/` and `ideas/pipeline/`
- **Promotes to pipeline**: Uses `ideate-promote.sh` for idea enhancement
- **Creates project structure**: Integrates with `work-init.sh` for full project setup
- **Archives idea**: Links idea to active project with traceability
- **Provides development guidance**: Next steps for implementation

## Claude Instructions

1. **Execute the script**: Run `./scripts/build.sh [idea-name]`
2. **Monitor project creation**: Display each step of the promotion and setup
3. **Validate structure**: Confirm project directory and files created properly
4. **Analyze project requirements**: Read the created spec.md to understand project scope
5. **Identify relevant agents**: Use the Agent Identification Logic below
6. **Create coordination plan**: Generate specific agent assignments and workflow
7. **Guide development**: Present agent recommendations and next steps
