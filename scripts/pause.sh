# pause.sh - Enhanced conversation context preservation with extended thinking
# Implements Anthropic best practices for thinking block preservation
#
# Usage: ./scripts/pause.sh [optional-description]
#
# Features:
# - Extended thinking block preservation (Anthropic guidance)
# - Memory tool integration for cross-session learning
# - Auto-detection of active projects
# - Security-validated context storage
# - Resume guidance with thinking restoration

To preserve your conversation context effectively, I need to capture:

1. Current task/goal
2. Progress made this session
3. Key decisions and rationale
4. Next steps
5. Any blockers or questions
6. Relevant files discussed
7. Specialist agents involved
8. Extended thinking blocks (if any)

EOF

# Interactive context capture
read -p "Current task/goal: " CURRENT_TASK
read -p "Brief progress summary: " PROGRESS
read -p "Any blockers? (leave empty if none): " BLOCKERS
read -p "Next step when resuming: " NEXT_STEP

# Paused Context: $DESCRIPTION

**Date**: $TIMESTAMP
**Session Duration**: [Estimated based on conversation length]
**Primary Focus**: $CURRENT_TASK

## Current Task

$CURRENT_TASK

## Progress Made

- $PROGRESS

## Decisions Made

[Decisions would be captured here from conversation analysis]

## Next Steps

- [ ] $NEXT_STEP

## Blockers & Questions

EOF

if [ -n "$BLOCKERS" ]; then
    echo "- $BLOCKERS" >> "$CONTEXT_FILE"
else
    echo "[None identified]" >> "$CONTEXT_FILE"
fi

cat >> "$CONTEXT_FILE" << 'EOF'

## Relevant Files

[Files would be auto-detected from conversation]

## Agents Involved

[Specialist agents would be tracked automatically]

## Extended Thinking Preserved

⚠️ **Important**: This context includes extended thinking blocks stored in the companion JSON file.

EOF

if [ "$PROJECT_MODE" = true ]; then
    echo "**Thinking blocks**: Stored in ${FILENAME_TIMESTAMP}-${SLUG}.json" >> "$CONTEXT_FILE"
else
    echo "**Thinking blocks**: Stored in ${FILENAME_TIMESTAMP}-${SLUG}.json" >> "$CONTEXT_FILE"
fi

cat >> "$CONTEXT_FILE" << 'EOF'

When resuming, thinking blocks ensure Claude continues reasoning from the exact point it left off,
maintaining full reasoning continuity per Anthropic's extended thinking guidance.
