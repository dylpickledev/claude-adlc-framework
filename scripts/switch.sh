# switch.sh - Seamless project/task switching workflow
# Usage: ./scripts/switch.sh [optional-new-branch-name]
#
# This script provides a complete context switch workflow:
# 1. Commit current work with auto-generated message
# 2. Push current branch to remote for preservation
# 3. Switch to main branch and sync
# 4. Clear Claude Code context
# 5. Optionally switch to specified branch
