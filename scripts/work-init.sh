## End Goal

$DESCRIPTION

<!-- Expand this section with specific, measurable outcomes -->

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Define specific success metrics here
- [ ] Add measurable completion criteria
- [ ] Include user/business value delivered

## Scope

### Included
- Core functionality to be delivered
- Systems and repositories affected
- Required integrations

### Excluded
- Out-of-scope items to avoid scope creep
- Future enhancements for later phases

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Analysis & Planning
- [ ] Initial investigation
- [ ] Requirements gathering
- [ ] Technical design
- [ ] Risk assessment

### Phase 2: Development
- [ ] Core implementation
- [ ] Testing framework
- [ ] Documentation

### Phase 3: Deployment & Validation
- [ ] Integration testing
- [ ] Production deployment
- [ ] Success metric validation

## Technical Requirements

### Systems Involved
- **Repositories:** (list affected repos)
- **Data Sources:** (if applicable)
- **Integration Points:** (APIs, databases, etc.)

### Tools & Technologies
- dbt (transformations)
- Snowflake (data warehouse)
- Tableau (reporting)
- Orchestra (orchestration)
- Other: (specify)

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Specific functional requirements
- [ ] User experience criteria
- [ ] Performance requirements

### Non-Functional Requirements

- Coordination required with other teams/projects

## Timeline Estimate

- **Analysis:** X days
- **Implementation:** X days  
- **Testing & Deployment:** X days
- **Total Estimated:** X days
