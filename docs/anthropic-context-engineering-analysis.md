---

## Anthropic Best Practices vs DA Agent Hub Current State

### 1. Context as Finite Resource

**Anthropic Recommendation**:
> "Treat context as a 'precious, finite resource'. Find the smallest possible set of high-signal tokens that maximize likelihood of desired outcome."

**Current DA Agent Hub** ✅ ALIGNED:
- **MCP tools provide just-in-time data access** (not pre-loading everything)
- **Specialists focus on domain-specific context** (not general knowledge)
- **Delegation protocols prepare minimal context** (task, state, requirements, constraints)

**Example from analytics-engineer-role delegation**:
```json
{
  "task": "Optimize slow incremental model",
  "current_state": "50M rows, 2-hour runtime",
  "requirements": "<30 min, handle late arrivals",
  "constraints": "Maintain referential integrity"
}
```

**Assessment**: ✅ Following best practice - minimal, high-signal context

**Improvement Opportunity** ⚠️:
- Add "context budgeting" guidelines to specialists
- Document which MCP queries are high-value vs low-value
- Create context prioritization framework

---

### 2. Just-in-Time Context Retrieval

**Anthropic Recommendation**:
> "Use lightweight identifiers like file paths or web links. Dynamically load data at runtime using tools. Enable progressive disclosure where agents incrementally discover relevant context."

**Current DA Agent Hub** ✅ STRONGLY ALIGNED:

**MCP Tool Usage**:
- **dbt-mcp**: Uses `unique_id` (lightweight identifier) to fetch model details just-in-time
  ```bash
  get_model_details(unique_id="model.project.customer_orders")
  ```
- **aws-api**: Uses resource ARNs to fetch infrastructure state dynamically
- **snowflake-mcp**: Uses table names to query data on-demand
- **git-mcp**: Uses commit SHAs for historical context

**Progressive Disclosure**:
```
analytics-engineer:
  ↓ Gets model unique_id (lightweight)
  ↓ DELEGATES to dbt-expert
dbt-expert:
  ├─ Uses unique_id → Fetches full model details (just-in-time)
  ├─ Discovers dependencies → Fetches parent models (progressive)
  ├─ Finds performance issue → Queries Snowflake execution (progressive)
  └─ Returns synthesis
```

**Assessment**: ✅✅ Excellent alignment - architecture designed for this

**No improvements needed**: Current approach follows Anthropic pattern perfectly

---

### 3. Sub-Agent Architecture with Specialized Tasks

**Anthropic Recommendation**:
> "Main agent coordinates high-level plan. Sub-agents perform focused work and return condensed summaries. Maintain clear separation of concerns."

**Current DA Agent Hub** ✅ STRONGLY ALIGNED:

**Implemented Pattern**:
```
Role Agent (Main Coordinator)
    ├─ Delegates to Specialist 1 (focused work)
    ├─ Delegates to Specialist 2 (focused work)
    └─ Synthesizes specialist outputs

Specialist (Sub-agent)
    ├─ Performs focused domain work
    ├─ Uses domain-specific MCP tools
    └─ Returns condensed, validated recommendation
```

**Real Example** (from research):
```
bi-developer-role (main coordinator):
    ├─ DELEGATE to tableau-expert → Dashboard optimization summary
    ├─ DELEGATE to snowflake-expert → Data source optimization summary
    ├─ DELEGATE to dbt-expert → Semantic layer optimization summary
    └─ Synthesizes into holistic dashboard improvement plan
```

**Clear Separation**:
- Roles: Coordination, synthesis, execution
- Specialists: Focused expertise, validation, recommendations

**Assessment**: ✅✅ Perfect alignment with Anthropic pattern

**Enhancement Opportunity** ⚠️:
- Add "condensed summary" requirement to specialist output standards
- Define max response length for specialist recommendations
- Create summary templates for specialists

---

### 4. Context Request Best Practices

**Anthropic Recommendation**:
> "Request minimal but sufficient information upfront. Use clear, direct language at the right altitude. Avoid overly complex or vague instructions."

**Current DA Agent Hub** ⚠️ PARTIALLY ALIGNED:

**What we do well** ✅:
- Delegation protocol requests specific context (task, state, requirements, constraints)
- Examples provided in delegation patterns
- Clear language in specialist descriptions

**What needs improvement** ⚠️:
1. **Roles don't explicitly request context from users before starting**
2. **No validation that user provided sufficient context**
3. **No clarification prompts if context incomplete**

**Example of what's MISSING**:
```
User: "Optimize my slow dbt model"

analytics-engineer-role SHOULD ask:
❓ "Which model specifically? (provide unique_id or model name)"
❓ "What's the current runtime and your target?"
❓ "What's the data volume and refresh frequency?"
❓ "Are there specific constraints (cost, SLA, dependencies)?"

THEN delegate to dbt-expert with complete context
```

**Current behavior**:
- Might proceed with incomplete context
- Specialist might have to guess
- Could lead to iterations and wasted tokens

**IMPROVEMENT NEEDED** 🎯:
- Add "Context Gathering Protocol" to all role agents
- Define required vs optional context for common tasks
- Create context validation checklist
- Add clarification prompts before delegation

---

### 5. Minimal Overlap in Tool Functionality

**Anthropic Recommendation**:
> "Ensure tools have minimal overlap in functionality to avoid confusion about which tool to use."

**Current DA Agent Hub** ✅ MOSTLY ALIGNED, ⚠️ SOME OVERLAP:

**Good separation**:
- dbt-mcp (transformation layer) vs snowflake-mcp (warehouse layer) - minimal overlap
- aws-api (infrastructure state) vs aws-docs (documentation) vs aws-knowledge (best practices) - clear distinctions
- git-mcp (version control) vs github-mcp (repository/PR management) - complementary

**Potential overlap**:
- snowflake-mcp can execute queries vs dbt-mcp can get compiled SQL
  - **Resolution**: Use snowflake-mcp for query EXECUTION, dbt-mcp for SQL GENERATION
- filesystem-mcp vs Read tool (Claude Code native)
  - **Resolution**: Use Read for local operations, filesystem-mcp for specialist file access

**Assessment**: ⚠️ Minor overlap, needs clarification in specialist docs

**IMPROVEMENT NEEDED** 🎯:
- Document MCP tool selection criteria in each specialist
- Add "when to use which tool" decision trees
- Clarify overlapping tool usage patterns

---

### 6. Structured Note-Taking for Persistent Memory

**Anthropic Recommendation**:
> "Implement structured note-taking to persist memory outside context window. Regularly prune and refine context."

**Current DA Agent Hub** ✅ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED:

**What we have** ✅:
- `.claude/memory/patterns/` for pattern documentation
- `.claude/memory/recent/` for recent solutions
- Pattern markers (PATTERN:, SOLUTION:, ERROR-FIX:, ARCHITECTURE:)
- Project-based documentation in `projects/active/*/`

**What we're missing** ⚠️:
- **Not using memory-mcp** (scheduled for Week 5 but should prioritize)
- **No automatic context compaction** after long conversations
- **No session summary generation** for pattern extraction
- **Specialists don't explicitly document learnings** to memory system

**IMPROVEMENT NEEDED** 🎯:
- Prioritize memory-mcp addition (move from Week 5 to Week 2)
- Add "Document Learnings" step to delegation protocol
- Create context compaction triggers (after N messages)
- Implement session summary generation
- Add memory persistence to specialist output protocol

---

### 7. Clear, Direct Language at Right Altitude

**Anthropic Recommendation**:
> "Use clear, direct language at the right altitude. Avoid overly complex or vague instructions."

**Current DA Agent Hub** ✅ WELL ALIGNED:

**Agent descriptions** ✅:
- Clear role definitions ("You are an Analytics Engineer specializing in...")
- Direct responsibility statements
- Specific confidence levels with examples

**Delegation protocols** ✅:
- 5-step process with concrete examples
- Context templates with actual values
- Expected outputs clearly defined

**Examples from agents** ✅:
```
DELEGATE TO: dbt-expert
TASK: "Design optimal incremental strategy for customer_transactions"
CONTEXT: {clear, specific context}
REQUEST: "Validated dbt model with tests and performance proof"
```

**Assessment**: ✅✅ Excellent alignment - language is clear and direct

**Minor Enhancement** ⚠️:
- Add "altitude guidance" to templates (when to be high-level vs detailed)
- Create user communication guidelines (how roles should ask users for context)

---

### 8. Provide Diverse, Canonical Examples

**Anthropic Recommendation**:
> "Provide diverse, canonical examples of expected behavior"

**Current DA Agent Hub** ✅ WELL IMPLEMENTED:

**Examples in documentation**:
- Real-world scenarios in `.claude/agents/README.md` (3 complete workflows)
- Delegation examples in each role (analytics-engineer, data-engineer, ui-ux-developer)
- MCP tool usage examples in each specialist
- Integration workflow examples (step-by-step)

**Variety of examples**:
- UI/UX deployment (ui-ux-developer → aws-expert)
- Model optimization (analytics-engineer → dbt-expert + snowflake-expert)
- Data ingestion (data-engineer → aws-expert + snowflake-expert)

**Assessment**: ✅ Good coverage, diverse scenarios

**Enhancement** ⚠️:
- Add more edge case examples (failures, complex scenarios)
- Include "what NOT to do" examples (anti-patterns)
- Add troubleshooting scenario examples

---

### 9. Compaction and Context Pruning

**Anthropic Recommendation**:
> "Implement compaction by summarizing conversation history. Regularly prune and refine context."

**Current DA Agent Hub** ⚠️ NOT IMPLEMENTED:

**What we're missing**:
- No automatic conversation summarization
- No context compaction after long specialist consultations
- No pruning of redundant information
- Specialists might return verbose outputs

**Current risk**:
- Long specialist responses consume context
- Multiple specialist delegations accumulate context
- Could hit context limits on complex multi-specialist scenarios

**IMPROVEMENT NEEDED** 🎯:
1. **Add to specialist output standards**:
   - "Return condensed summaries, not full data dumps"
   - "Provide executive summary + details structure"
   - "Maximum 500 words for standard recommendations"

2. **Add compaction triggers**:
   - After 3+ specialist delegations → Summary current state
   - After long specialist response → Ask for condensed version
   - Before hitting context limits → Prune old conversation

3. **Implement in Week 2**:
   - Add "Response Compaction" section to specialist-template.md
   - Update existing specialists with summary requirements
   - Test with multi-specialist scenarios

---

### 10. Tool Results Management

**Anthropic Recommendation**:
> "Clear redundant tool call results. Don't accumulate unnecessary data in context."

**Current DA Agent Hub** ✅ ALIGNED via MCP Design:

**How MCP helps**:
- MCP tools return focused results (not full data dumps)
- Tools are query-specific (get exactly what's needed)
- Results are consumed by specialists, then synthesized

**Example**:
```
dbt-expert:
  ├─ Calls: get_model_details(unique_id="...") → Returns just that model
  ├─ NOT: Fetching all models then filtering
  ├─ Analyzes focused result
  └─ Returns synthesis (not raw MCP output)
```

**Assessment**: ✅ MCP architecture inherently supports this

**Minor Enhancement** ⚠️:
- Document "focused query" patterns in MCP tool examples
- Add "query efficiency" to specialist quality standards
- Avoid redundant MCP calls

---

**Overall**: 8.5/10 - Strong foundation, key improvements needed in context compaction and user context gathering

---

## Critical Improvements Needed

### Priority 1: Add Context Gathering Protocol to Roles (HIGH - Week 2)

**Problem**: Roles don't explicitly request context from users before starting work

**Anthropic guidance**: "Request minimal but sufficient information upfront"

**Solution**: Add "User Context Gathering" section to all role agents

**Template** (add to role-template.md and existing roles):
```markdown
## User Context Gathering Protocol

### Before Starting Work

**ALWAYS ask users for**:
1. **Specific target**: What exactly needs to be worked on? (model name, app name, pipeline name)
2. **Current state**: What exists now? (performance metrics, current config)
3. **Requirements**: What's the goal? (performance target, cost target, quality needs)
4. **Constraints**: What are the limitations? (timeline, budget, dependencies, SLAs)

### Context Validation Checklist

Before proceeding, ensure you have:
- [ ] Specific target identified (not vague "optimize my models")
- [ ] Current state quantified (numbers, metrics, not "it's slow")
- [ ] Requirements defined (targets, not "make it better")
- [ ] Constraints documented (what can't change, must maintain)

### Example Context Gathering

❌ **Insufficient**:
User: "Optimize my dbt model"
Role: *Proceeds to delegate without clarification*

✅ **Correct**:
User: "Optimize my dbt model"
Role: "I can help with that. I need some context first:
  1. Which specific model? (provide model name or unique_id)
  2. What's the current runtime and your target?
  3. What's the data volume and refresh frequency?
  4. Are there specific constraints? (dependencies, SLAs, must maintain logic)"

User provides context → Role validates completeness → Then delegates to specialist
```

**Impact**: Reduces wasted specialist effort, improves first-attempt success rate

---

### Priority 2: Implement Context Compaction (HIGH - Week 2)

**Problem**: No automatic summarization after long specialist consultations

**Anthropic guidance**: "Implement compaction by summarizing conversation history"

**Solution**: Add compaction triggers and summary protocols

**Implementation**:

1. **Add to specialist output standards**:
```markdown
## Response Format Standard

### Executive Summary (Required)
- **Problem**: One-sentence problem statement
- **Solution**: One-sentence solution approach
- **Impact**: Expected improvement (quantified)

### Detailed Recommendations (Expandable)
[Full details only if user requests or complexity requires]

### Implementation Quick Start (Required)
- Step 1: [Most critical action]
- Step 2: [Second most critical]
- Step 3: [Third most critical]

### Validation Checklist (Required)
- [ ] How to verify solution works
- [ ] Expected outcomes
- [ ] Rollback if needed

**Maximum**: 500 words for standard recommendations, 1000 words for complex
```

2. **Add compaction triggers**:
```markdown
TRIGGER compaction when:
- After 3+ specialist delegations in one conversation
- After specialist response >1000 words
- When context approaching limit (proactive)

COMPACTION ACTION:
1. Summarize: "Based on [specialist] recommendations: [1-2 sentence summary]"
2. Document: Save full details to .claude/memory/patterns/
3. Continue: With condensed context
```

**Impact**: Prevents context bloat, maintains focus, enables longer conversations

---

### Priority 3: Add memory-mcp to Week 2 (CRITICAL - Move Up from Week 5)

**Problem**: No persistent knowledge graph for cross-session learning

**Anthropic guidance**: "Use structured note-taking to persist memory outside context window"

**Current**: Scheduled for Week 5, but should be Week 2 priority

**Solution**: Move memory-mcp to Week 2 implementation

**Why critical**:
- Enables cross-session pattern learning
- Reduces need for repeated specialist consultations
- Builds institutional knowledge efficiently
- Supports context compaction (summarize → persist → prune)

**Implementation** (Week 2, Day 1-2):
```json
// Add to .claude/mcp.json
"memory": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"],
  "disabled": false,
  "autoApprove": []
}
```

**Usage by specialists**:
```
dbt-expert:
  ├─ Solves complex incremental model problem
  ├─ Returns recommendation to role
  └─ ALSO: Persists pattern to memory-mcp
      - Pattern: "Incremental deduplication with late arrivals"
      - Solution: [Technical approach]
      - When to use: [Criteria]

Next time similar problem:
  ├─ dbt-expert queries memory-mcp first
  ├─ Finds existing pattern
  └─ Adapts proven solution (faster, more confident)
```

**Impact**: Builds learning system, reduces redundant specialist consultations over time

---

### Priority 4: Structured Context Templates (MEDIUM - Week 2)

**Problem**: Context format varies by role/specialist

**Anthropic guidance**: "Use XML or Markdown to structure context sections"

**Solution**: Create standardized context template

**Implementation**:

**Context Template** (add to all role agents):
```markdown
## Standard Context Format

When delegating to specialists, use this structure:

```xml
<delegation>
  <specialist>dbt-expert</specialist>

  <task>
    <description>Optimize slow incremental model with complex deduplication</description>
    <target>customer_transactions model</target>
  </task>

  <current_state>
    <model_name>customer_transactions</model_name>
    <runtime>2 hours</runtime>
    <data_volume>50M rows</data_volume>
    <refresh_frequency>Daily</refresh_frequency>
  </current_state>

  <requirements>
    <performance_target>< 30 minutes</performance_target>
    <data_quality>Handle late arrivals</data_quality>
    <historical>Support historical updates</historical>
  </requirements>

  <constraints>
    <referential_integrity>Must maintain with existing marts</referential_integrity>
    <sla>4-hour window for daily refresh</sla>
  </constraints>
</delegation>
```

**Benefits**:
- Structured, parseable context
- Forces completeness (missing sections obvious)
- Specialists can validate context quality
- Reduces ambiguity

**Impact**: Higher quality delegations, fewer clarification rounds

## How to Ensure Proper Context (User Guide)

### For Users: How to Provide Good Context

**When asking Claude to do work**, provide:

1. **Specific Target** 🎯:
   - ❌ "Optimize my dbt models"
   - ✅ "Optimize customer_transactions incremental model"

2. **Current State** 📊:
   - ❌ "It's slow"
   - ✅ "Currently takes 2 hours to run, processes 50M rows daily"

3. **Requirements** 🎯:
   - ❌ "Make it faster"
   - ✅ "Target: <30 minutes runtime, must handle late-arriving data"

4. **Constraints** ⚠️:
   - ❌ "Just fix it"
   - ✅ "Must maintain referential integrity with marts, 4-hour SLA window"

### For Claude: How to Gather Complete Context

**Before starting work**, ALWAYS ask:

**Template Questions**:
```
I can help with [task]. To provide the best solution, I need:

1. **Specific target**: [Which model/app/pipeline/resource exactly?]
2. **Current state**: [What's the current performance/config/behavior?]
3. **Requirements**: [What's your target/goal? (be specific with numbers)]
4. **Constraints**: [What must remain unchanged? Timeline? Budget? Dependencies?]

Once I have this context, I'll [delegate to specialist / handle directly] and provide [expected output].
```

**Validation before proceeding**:
```
Context Check:
✅ Specific: customer_transactions model (unique_id: model.analytics.customer_transactions)
✅ State: 2-hour runtime, 50M rows, daily refresh
✅ Requirements: <30 min runtime, handle late data, support historical updates
✅ Constraints: Maintain referential integrity, 4-hour SLA

Proceeding to delegate to dbt-expert with complete context.
```

## Context Engineering Best Practices for DA Agent Hub

### 1. Start Every Task with Context Gathering

**Role agent behavior**:
```
User: "Optimize my Snowflake costs"

analytics-engineer-role (correct):
  "I can help optimize Snowflake costs. I need some context:

   1. Current monthly cost? (from Snowflake account or estimate)
   2. Main cost drivers? (storage, compute, data transfer - or unknown)
   3. Target cost reduction? (specific % or $amount, or just 'as much as possible')
   4. Constraints? (performance SLAs, query patterns that must maintain)

   Once I have this, I'll consult snowflake-expert who will use
   snowflake-mcp to analyze your actual usage and provide validated
   optimization recommendations."

User provides context → Role validates → Delegates with complete context → Success
```

### 2. Use Lightweight Identifiers, Fetch Just-in-Time

**Already doing well** ✅:
```
User: "Analyze customer_orders model"

analytics-engineer:
  ↓ Stores: unique_id="model.analytics.customer_orders" (lightweight)
  ↓ DELEGATES to dbt-expert
dbt-expert:
  ├─ Uses unique_id → Fetches model details just-in-time (dbt-mcp)
  ├─ Discovers dependencies → Fetches parent models progressively
  └─ Returns synthesis (not raw data)
```

**Keep doing this** - it follows Anthropic pattern perfectly.

### 3. Request Condensed Summaries from Specialists

**New requirement for specialists**:
```markdown
## Response Format (Required)

### Executive Summary (3-5 sentences)
- Problem identified
- Recommended solution
- Expected impact

### Key Recommendations (Bullet points)
- Top 3-5 most important actions
- Priority ordered

### Detailed Analysis (Expandable - only if requested)
- Full technical details
- Alternative approaches
- Trade-off analysis

### Quick Start Implementation (Required)
- Step 1: [Most critical action]
- Step 2: [Next action]
- Step 3: [Validation]
```

**Impact**: Condensed responses preserve context budget

### 4. Implement Session Summaries

**After complex multi-specialist work**:
```
analytics-engineer (after consulting 3 specialists):
  "Session Summary:
   - Consulted dbt-expert: Incremental model optimization (8 min target achieved)
   - Consulted snowflake-expert: Clustering strategy (50% cost reduction)
   - Consulted business-context: Metric validation (stakeholder approved)

   Combined solution: Optimized customer_metrics model
   - Runtime: 2 hours → 8 minutes (85% improvement)
   - Cost: $200/month → $100/month (50% reduction)
   - Quality: All tests passing, business logic validated

   Next: Deploy to production, monitor results"
```

**Benefit**: Provides compact summary, can prune detailed specialist responses

### 5. Progressive Disclosure with MCP

**Continue this pattern** ✅:
```
Start with minimal:
  └─ Get model unique_id

Progressively discover:
  ├─ Fetch model details (if needed)
  ├─ Fetch parent dependencies (if performance issue)
  ├─ Fetch Snowflake query profile (if warehouse issue)
  └─ Fetch git history (if regression suspected)

Don't fetch everything upfront.
```

## Proposed Enhancements

### Enhancement 1: Context Gathering Templates

**File**: `.claude/memory/templates/context-gathering-templates.md`

**Contents**:
```markdown
# Context Gathering Templates by Task Type

## Data Model Optimization
Required context:
- Model unique_id or name
- Current runtime (specific number)
- Data volume (row count)
- Refresh frequency
- Performance target
- Constraints (referential integrity, SLA)

## AWS Deployment
Required context:
- Application type (React, Streamlit, etc.)
- Current infrastructure (ECS service name, ALB, etc.)
- Deployment requirements (zero downtime, auth method)
- Cost target
- Constraints (existing services, security requirements)

## Cost Optimization
Required context:
- Current cost (specific $amount or usage metrics)
- Cost drivers (if known - compute, storage, etc.)
- Target reduction (specific % or $amount)
- Performance constraints (SLAs that must be maintained)
- Time constraints (when optimization needed)
```

Add template reference to each role agent.

### Enhancement 2: Specialist Response Format Standard

**Update**: All specialist agents

**Add section**:
```markdown
## Response Format Standard

### Required Structure

**Executive Summary** (3-5 sentences):
- Problem: [What was identified]
- Solution: [Approach taken]
- Impact: [Expected improvement - quantified]

**Key Recommendations** (Top 3-5):
1. [Most critical action with brief rationale]
2. [Second most critical]
3. [Third most critical]

**Implementation Quick Start**:
- Step 1: [Immediate action]
- Step 2: [Follow-up]
- Validation: [How to verify success]

**Detailed Analysis** (Provide only if):
- User explicitly requests details
- Complexity requires explanation
- Multiple approaches need comparison

**Maximum Length**:
- Standard recommendation: 500 words
- Complex scenario: 1000 words
- If more needed: Provide summary + offer details on request
```

### Enhancement 3: memory-mcp Priority Increase

**Change**: Move memory-mcp from Week 5 to Week 2

**Rationale**:
- Anthropic emphasizes persistent memory
- Current pattern documentation is manual
- memory-mcp automates pattern capture
- Critical for learning and reducing redundant consultations

**Implementation** (Week 2, Day 1):
```json
"memory": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"],
  "disabled": false,
  "autoApprove": []
}
```

**Usage pattern**:
```
After specialist consultation:
  1. Role receives recommendation
  2. Specialist ALSO persists to memory-mcp:
     - Pattern type
     - Problem solved
     - Solution approach
     - When to use
  3. Future similar problems:
     - Query memory-mcp first
     - Adapt proven pattern
     - Faster, more confident
```

### Enhancement 4: Context Validation Checkpoints

**Add to delegation protocol** (all roles):

**Step 2.5: Validate Context Before Delegating**:
```markdown
Before delegating, validate context completeness:

Required:
- [ ] Specific target identified (model name, app name, resource ID)
- [ ] Current state quantified (metrics, not descriptions)
- [ ] Requirements defined (specific targets, not "better")
- [ ] Constraints documented (what can't change)

If ANY missing:
  → Ask user for clarification
  → Do NOT proceed with incomplete context
  → Do NOT make assumptions

Once validated:
  → Proceed to delegate with complete, validated context
```

## Summary of Anthropic Analysis

### What DA Agent Hub Does Right ✅

1. **Sub-agent architecture**: Role → Specialist pattern (Anthropic recommended)
2. **Just-in-time context**: MCP tools with lightweight identifiers (perfect alignment)
3. **Focused specialists**: Clear domain separation (Anthropic pattern)
4. **Progressive disclosure**: MCP queries as needed, not upfront data dumps
5. **Minimal tool overlap**: Clear MCP assignments by specialist
6. **Clear language**: Direct, specific agent descriptions and protocols
7. **Diverse examples**: Real-world scenarios in documentation

### What Needs Enhancement ⚠️

1. **User context gathering**: Roles should explicitly request context (not proceed with incomplete)
2. **Context compaction**: Specialists should return condensed summaries
3. **memory-mcp priority**: Move to Week 2 (from Week 5) for persistent learning
4. **Structured templates**: XML/Markdown format for context
5. **Response length limits**: Max 500-1000 words for specialist recommendations
6. **Context validation**: Checkpoints before delegation

### Implementation Priority

**Week 2 Additions** (HIGH PRIORITY):
1. Context gathering protocol (all roles)
2. Response format standard (all specialists)
3. memory-mcp integration
4. Context validation checkpoints

**Estimated additional time**: 8-12 hours in Week 2

**ROI**: Significantly better context quality, reduced wasted effort, faster resolution

---

## Updated Week 2 Plan

**Original Week 2** (5-10 hours):
- Update 6 remaining role agents with delegation protocols

**Enhanced Week 2** (15-20 hours):
- Add context gathering protocols to ALL roles
- Add response format standards to ALL specialists
- Add memory-mcp (MOVED UP from Week 5)
- Create context-gathering-templates.md
- Update templates (role, specialist)
- Test context engineering improvements
- Update remaining 6 role agents

**Justification**: Anthropic best practices are foundation-level, worth the additional investment
