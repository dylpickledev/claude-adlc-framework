# Agents vs Skills: Comprehensive Analysis and Recommendations

**Date**: 2025-10-25
**Based on**: Anthropic Official Documentation (docs.claude.com)
**Repository**: claude-adlc-framework (DA Agent Hub)

---

## Executive Summary

Based on Anthropic's official documentation, **agents** and **skills** serve fundamentally different purposes in Claude Code:

- **Agents (Sub-agents)**: Specialized AI assistants with **separate context windows**, used for expert consultation and task delegation
- **Skills**: Autonomous, **model-invoked capabilities** that extend Claude's functionality, activated automatically based on context

**Key Finding**: The DA Agent Hub currently has **correct agent architecture** but could benefit from **converting some procedural agents to skills** for autonomous activation.

## Part 1: What Are Agents? (From Anthropic Documentation)

### Definition
**From Anthropic Sub-agents Documentation**:
> "Subagents are specialized AI assistants that Claude Code can delegate tasks to. Each operates with its own context window separate from the main conversation."

### Core Characteristics

**1. Isolation & Focus**
- Separate context window from main conversation
- Prevents conversation pollution
- Keeps main thread focused on high-level goals

**2. Specialization**
- Tailored for specific domains with custom system prompts
- Improves success rates on designated task categories
- Deep expertise in narrow areas

**3. Explicit Invocation**
- Automatic delegation by Claude based on task descriptions
- Explicit invocation: `claude --agent code-reviewer "Check my changes"`
- User or main Claude decides when to delegate

**4. Reusability**
- Function across different projects
- Can be shared with teams via version control
- Consistent workflows organization-wide

**5. Granular Permissions**
- Individual tool access restrictions per agent
- Limit powerful capabilities to appropriate contexts
- Security through tool restrictions

### When to Use Agents

**From Anthropic Common Workflows**:
> "Use subagents when you need specialized AI subagents to handle specific tasks more effectively."

**Examples from documentation**:
- Automatic delegation for code review, testing, performance optimization
- Task-specific expertise (security auditing, API design)
- Team workflows requiring consistent specialized handling

**Decision trigger**: Multiple people need the same specialized capability across projects

### Agent Design Best Practices

**From Anthropic Documentation**:
1. **Start by generating with Claude, then customize**
2. **Design focused agents** with single responsibilities
3. **Write detailed system prompts** with specific instructions
4. **Restrict tools** to necessary capabilities only
5. **Version control** project-level agents for team collaboration

---

## Part 2: What Are Skills? (From Anthropic Documentation)

### Definition
**From Anthropic Skills Documentation**:
> "Agent Skills are modular capabilities that extend Claude's functionality in Claude Code. They consist of a SKILL.md file containing instructions, plus optional supporting files like scripts and templates."

**Critical distinction**:
> "Skills are model-invoked—Claude autonomously decides when to use them based on your request and the Skill's description. This differs from slash commands, which users explicitly trigger."

### Core Characteristics

**1. Autonomous Invocation**
- Claude discovers and activates skills automatically
- No explicit invocation needed
- Based on skill description matching user context

**2. Procedural Workflow Automation**
- Step-by-step instructions for repeatable processes
- Support templates, scripts, and supporting files
- Progressive disclosure (load details only when needed)

**3. Tool Restrictions**
- Optional `allowed-tools` field for security
- Can create read-only skills
- Constrain capabilities for specific workflows

**4. Modular & Focused**
- One skill = one capability
- Compose multiple skills for complex tasks
- Keep skills focused, not multi-purpose

**5. Team Sharing**
- Project-level skills (`.claude/skills/`) shared via git
- User-level skills (`~/.claude/skills/`) for personal workflows
- Plugin skills for marketplace distribution

### When to Use Skills

**From Anthropic Skills Documentation Decision Framework**:

**Use Skills when**:
- Autonomous, model-invoked behavior desired
- Functionality should activate automatically based on context
- Read-only operations or constrained capabilities needed
- Creating reusable capabilities across projects

**Use Agents when**:
- User explicitly requests specialized expertise
- Complex multi-step workflows requiring context isolation
- Need separate conversation thread for focused work

### Skill Design Best Practices

**From Anthropic Documentation**:
1. **Keep Skills focused**: One skill addresses one capability
2. **Write specific descriptions**: Include what it does AND when to use it
3. **Progressive disclosure**: Reference supporting docs from SKILL.md, don't inline everything
4. **Test activation**: Verify model discovers skill by asking relevant questions
5. **Tool restrictions**: Use `allowed-tools` for read-only or constrained skills

## Part 3: Key Differences (Agents vs Skills)

| Dimension | Agents (Sub-agents) | Skills |
|-----------|---------------------|--------|
| **Purpose** | Expert consultation, specialized analysis | Procedural workflow automation |
| **Invocation** | Explicit delegation by user or Claude | Autonomous, model-invoked based on context |
| **Context** | Separate context window (isolated) | Same context as main conversation |
| **Decision-Making** | AI-powered expertise and recommendations | Follows procedural instructions |
| **Best For** | Complex analysis, deep domain expertise | Repeatable workflows, templates, automation |
| **Example** | "Analyze this dbt model performance" | "Generate dbt model boilerplate" |
| **Tool Access** | Full tool suite (Read, Write, Bash, etc.) | Optional restrictions (read-only, limited) |
| **State Management** | Separate conversation thread | No separate thread |
| **When to Use** | Need expert judgment and analysis | Need consistent procedural execution |

## Part 6: Implementation Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (No Changes Needed)

The DA Agent Hub architecture is **fundamentally correct** based on Anthropic best practices:

1. ✅ **Agents are used for expertise** (dbt-expert, snowflake-expert, etc.)
2. ✅ **Skills are used for procedures** (project-setup, dbt-model-scaffolder, etc.)
3. ✅ **Role agents delegate to specialists** at appropriate confidence thresholds
4. ✅ **Skills handle workflow automation** (PR generation, validation, scaffolding)

**No immediate restructuring required.**

### Future Enhancements (Optional)

If pursuing additional optimization:

#### 1. Create Additional Skills for Common Procedures
- **mcp-validator-skill**: Autonomous MCP configuration validation
- **git-branch-helper-skill**: Autonomous branch creation with naming conventions
- **pattern-extractor-skill**: Autonomous pattern extraction from projects
- **test-runner-skill**: Autonomous test execution based on project type

#### 2. Enhance Skill Descriptions for Better Discovery
Current skills have good descriptions, but could be more trigger-specific:

**Example Enhancement**:
```yaml
# Current
name: project-setup
description: Initialize new ADLC project with standard directory structure

# Enhanced for Discovery
name: project-setup
description: |
  Initialize new ADLC project with standard directory structure,
  documentation templates, and git branch. Use when starting a new
  project, creating project structure, or beginning development work.
  Automatically invoked by /start command.
```

#### 3. Document Agent vs Skill Decision Framework

Create `.claude/memory/patterns/agent-vs-skill-decision-framework.md`:

**When creating new automation, ask**:
1. **Does it require expert judgment?** → Agent
2. **Is it a repeatable procedure?** → Skill
3. **Should it activate automatically?** → Skill
4. **Does it need separate context?** → Agent

## Part 9: Decision Framework for Future Components

### When to Create a New Agent

**Ask these questions**:
1. Does it require **expert judgment and analysis**? → Agent
2. Does it need to **make complex decisions**? → Agent
3. Would it benefit from **separate context window**? → Agent
4. Does it need **deep domain expertise**? → Agent
5. Will multiple people need this **specialized capability**? → Agent

**Examples**:
- **security-expert** (security audits, vulnerability analysis)
- **performance-expert** (cross-system performance optimization)
- **data-quality-specialist** (advanced data quality frameworks)

### When to Create a New Skill

**Ask these questions**:
1. Is it a **repeatable procedure**? → Skill
2. Can it be **step-by-step automated**? → Skill
3. Should it **activate autonomously** based on context? → Skill
4. Is it **template-driven** or **checklist-based**? → Skill
5. Does it **not require expertise** to execute? → Skill

**Examples**:
- **mcp-validator-skill** (validate MCP configuration)
- **test-runner-skill** (run appropriate tests based on project type)
- **pattern-extractor-skill** (extract patterns from project docs)

### The Critical Question

**"If I were teaching a junior developer to do this, would I be teaching them PROCEDURES or EXPERTISE?"**

- **Procedures** → Skill (they can follow steps)
- **Expertise** → Agent (they need years of experience)
