**Orchestrator-Workers Pattern** (`patterns/agents/orchestrator_workers.ipynb`)
- **Pattern**: Dynamic task decomposition and worker delegation
- **Implementation**:
  ```markdown
  ## Multi-Agent Coordination Pattern

  ### Dynamic Task Decomposition
  1. Analyze complex task to identify subtasks
  2. Determine which specialists needed (dbt, Snowflake, Tableau, etc.)
  3. Create context-rich task assignments
  4. Track dependencies between subtasks

  ### Worker Delegation
  - Pass full context to each specialist
  - Include project state, previous findings, constraints
  - Allow specialists to request additional context
  - Aggregate results with synthesis

  ### Code Pattern
  ```python
  def coordinate_specialists(self, complex_task: str):
      # Decompose into specialist tasks
      tasks = self.decompose(complex_task)

      # Delegate with context
      results = []
      for task in tasks:
          specialist = self.select_specialist(task.domain)
          result = specialist.execute(task, context=self.project_context)
          results.append(result)

      # Synthesize final answer
      return self.synthesize(results)
  ```
  ```

- Identify gaps in current patterns
- Add new cookbooks as Anthropic releases them
- Retire outdated patterns

### Continuous Learning
- Track specialist performance metrics
- Identify underperforming patterns
- Refine based on real-world usage
- Share learnings across specialists

### Future Specialist Onboarding
- When reviving future specialists, refer to this roadmap
- Apply relevant cookbook patterns from day one
- Accelerate specialist effectiveness with proven patterns
- Inherit universal patterns (memory, caching, RAG, etc.)
