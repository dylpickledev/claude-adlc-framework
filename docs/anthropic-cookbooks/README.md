# Anthropic Cookbooks Integration

**Repository**: https://github.com/anthropics/claude-cookbooks
**Integration Date**: 2025-10-05
**Strategy**: Hybrid (Index + Curated + Pattern Extraction)

## Overview

This directory contains **production-ready code patterns** from Anthropic's Claude Cookbooks repository, integrated into the DA Agent Hub to enhance specialist agent capabilities. The integration follows a **hybrid approach** combining:

1. **Local copies** of top 10 high-value cookbooks
2. **Complete index** linking to all 50+ cookbooks in Anthropic's repository
3. **Extracted patterns** mapped to specialist agents

## What Are Anthropic Cookbooks?

Anthropic Cookbooks are **production-ready code examples and patterns** for building with Claude AI. They cover:

- **Multi-agent systems** (orchestrator-workers, routing, coordination)
- **Tool usage** (memory, caching, MCP integration, evaluation)
- **Data & analytics** (text-to-SQL, RAG, summarization)
- **Context management** (prompt caching, extended thinking)
- **Quality assurance** (evaluations, testing, validation)

### Why Integrate Them?

**For DA Agent Hub**, cookbooks provide:
- **Proven patterns** - Battle-tested approaches from Anthropic
- **Performance gains** - 2x faster responses with caching
- **Cost optimization** - 90% cost reduction via caching + batch
- **Quality improvements** - Higher accuracy through evaluations and extended thinking
- **Rapid development** - Copy-paste patterns vs reinventing the wheel

## How to Use Cookbooks

### As a Specialist Agent

**When to use LOCAL cookbooks** (`high-value/`):
- ‚úÖ **Immediate need** - Critical patterns for active tasks
- ‚úÖ **Frequent usage** - Core capabilities (memory, caching, coordination)
- ‚úÖ **Offline work** - No internet required
- ‚úÖ **Fast access** - No WebFetch overhead

**When to FETCH from index**:
- ‚úÖ **Exploratory** - Discovering new approaches
- ‚úÖ **Rare use cases** - Niche patterns used occasionally
- ‚úÖ **Latest updates** - Need cutting-edge patterns
- ‚úÖ **Specialized domains** - Domain-specific cookbooks (e.g., vision, audio)

**Example Workflow**:
```markdown
# dbt-expert receives SQL generation request

1. Check local patterns: high-value/text-to-sql.ipynb
2. Apply chain-of-thought generation pattern
3. If needed, fetch advanced patterns from index
4. Store successful approach in memory for next time
```

### As a Human Developer

**Navigation Flow**:
1. **Start here** (README.md) - Get oriented
2. **Browse catalog** (cookbook-catalog.md) - See all available cookbooks
3. **Check high-value** (high-value-cookbooks.md) - Top patterns with analysis
4. **View local** (high-value/) - Critical cookbooks for offline use
5. **Explore index** (index.md) - Full repository links
6. **See patterns** (patterns-by-specialist.md) - What specialists can do

**Finding Patterns**:
- **By problem type**: Check [Cookbook Catalog](cookbook-catalog.md) categories
- **By specialist**: Check [Specialist Roadmap](specialist-enhancement-roadmap.md)
- **By priority**: Check [High-Value Cookbooks](high-value-cookbooks.md)

**Using Patterns**:
```markdown
# Example: Need SQL generation pattern

1. Find in catalog: "Text-to-SQL" (skills/text_to_sql/guide.ipynb)
2. Check if local: Yes, in high-value/text-to-sql.ipynb
3. Read pattern: Chain-of-thought generation + RAG + self-improvement
4. See specialist: dbt-expert has this pattern integrated
5. Use: Ask dbt-expert to generate SQL from natural language
```

## FAQ

### Q: Which cookbook should I use for [specific problem]?
**A**: Check the [Cookbook Catalog](cookbook-catalog.md) and search for your problem type. Categories include Multi-Agent, Tool Use, Data Analysis, Context Management, etc.

### Q: How do I know if a cookbook is available locally?
**A**: Check the `high-value/` directory. Top 10 critical cookbooks are available offline. For others, use the index with WebFetch.

### Q: What if I need a pattern not in high-value/?
**A**: Use the [Complete Index](index.md) to find the cookbook on GitHub, then use WebFetch to retrieve it. If it's valuable, consider adding to high-value/ via PR.

### Q: How do specialists know which patterns to use?
**A**: Specialists have patterns integrated in their agent files (`.claude/agents/specialists/*.md`). They automatically apply relevant patterns based on task context.

### Q: Can I use cookbooks directly or should I go through specialists?
**A**: Both! For quick reference, read cookbooks directly. For execution, ask relevant specialist to apply the pattern (they're optimized for it).

### Q: What if a cookbook is outdated?
**A**: Check the [Changelog](maintenance/changelog.md) for updates. If you find outdated patterns, submit PR or notify da-architect for quarterly review.

### Q: How do I request a new pattern?
**A**: Create an issue describing the need, or find the cookbook in the index and submit PR following the [Contributing Guide](#contributing-new-patterns).

### Q: What's the difference between local cookbooks and the index?
**A**: Local (`high-value/`) are top 10 critical patterns for offline access. Index lists all 50+ cookbooks with GitHub links for exploratory use.

### Q: Which specialist should I ask for [specific task]?
**A**: Check the [Specialist Roadmap](specialist-enhancement-roadmap.md) to see which specialist has which patterns integrated.

### Q: How often are cookbooks updated?
**A**: Quarterly reviews (every 3 months) + ad-hoc updates for major changes. See [Maintenance Schedule](maintenance/update-schedule.md).
