### I need to know...

#### "How should role-based agents use MCP tools?"
→ **[Executive Summary - Quick Answer](./role-mcp-integration-summary.md#quick-answer-how-should-roles-use-mcp-tools)**

**Answer**: Roles should directly use MCP tools for domain tasks (80% of work), and consult specialist sub-agents for complex edge cases (20% of work).

---

#### "What's the recommended architecture?"
→ **[Architecture Diagrams - Three-Layer Pattern](./role-mcp-architecture-diagram.md#1-three-layer-architecture-overview)**

**Answer**:
```
Layer 1: Role Agent (orchestrator) - 80% independent
Layer 2: MCP Tools (aws-api, aws-docs, aws-knowledge) - enhance capability
Layer 3: Specialist Agent (consultant) - 20% for edge cases
```

---

#### "What are the performance benefits?"
→ **[Executive Summary - Key Benefits](./role-mcp-integration-summary.md#key-benefits)**

**Answer**:
- 50-70% reduction in coordination overhead
- 80% independent task handling by roles
- +0.05 to +0.30 confidence boost from MCP tools
- Infrastructure audits: 0.65 → 0.95 confidence

---

#### "When should a role consult a specialist?"
→ **[Architecture Diagrams - Consultation Triggers](./role-mcp-architecture-diagram.md#7-specialist-consultation-triggers)**

**Answer**: When confidence <0.85 on specific service/pattern (e.g., SageMaker 0.45, EKS 0.50, Step Functions 0.55)

---

#### "What MCP tools are available for AWS?"
→ **[Comprehensive Report - AWS MCP Servers](./role-based-agent-mcp-integration-research.md#23-aws-mcp-server-integration-patterns)**

**Answer**:
- `aws-api`: Read-only AWS service operations (infrastructure state)
- `aws-docs`: Latest API references and documentation
- `aws-knowledge`: Well-Architected Framework and best practices
- `aws-cloud-control`: Natural language infrastructure management

---

#### "What do industry experts say?"
→ **[Comprehensive Report - Sources & References](./role-based-agent-mcp-integration-research.md#6-sources--references)**

**Answer**: 20+ sources from Anthropic, AWS, Medium, Substack, and Azure/IBM documenting orchestrator-worker patterns, MCP integration strategies, and multi-agent coordination best practices.

---

## 🔍 Research Highlights

### Key Finding
**Role-based agents should directly use MCP tools** while maintaining **specialist consultation** for complex cases.

### Evidence Base
- **Anthropic Official**: 90% performance improvement with orchestrator-worker pattern
- **DA Agent Hub**: 50-70% coordination reduction with role-based migration
- **Industry Consensus**: 80/20 rule (80% independent, 20% consultation)

### Recommended Pattern
```
cloud-manager-role (80% work)
    ↓ Direct MCP access
aws-api, aws-docs, aws-knowledge (confidence boost)
    ↓ When confidence <0.85
aws-expert (20% consultation)
```

## 📊 Performance Metrics

### Coordination Efficiency
- **Old architecture**: 6 agents, 5 handoffs, 3 hours
- **New architecture**: 2 agents, 1 optional handoff, 1 hour
- **Improvement**: 50-70% faster

### Confidence Enhancement via MCP
- Infrastructure audits: 0.65 → 0.95 (+0.30)
- Cost analysis: 0.89 → 0.95 (+0.06)
- Security review: 0.70 → 0.90 (+0.20)
- Compliance: 0.60 → 0.88 (+0.28)

### Task Distribution
- **80%** handled independently by role agents
- **20%** require specialist consultation
- **15x** token cost justified by performance gains
