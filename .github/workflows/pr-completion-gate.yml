This PR needs a completion decision before it can be merged. Please add one of these labels:

### 📋 **Decision Framework**

**🎯 Add \`claude:complete\` if this PR involves:**
- New agent capabilities or improvements
- Documentation that could be enhanced
- Knowledge extraction opportunities
- Code that needs final polish/optimization
- Cross-system integration patterns worth preserving

**⏭️ Add \`claude:skip\` if this PR:**
- Is a simple fix/typo with no learning value
- Contains sensitive information that shouldn't be processed
- Is already comprehensively documented
- Has time constraints that don't allow for completion

**🚫 Add \`claude:no-need\` if this PR:**
- Is a dependency update or automated change
- Contains only configuration/settings changes
- Is a pure deletion with no replacement logic
- Has no documentation or agent improvement potential

### 💰 **Cost Consideration**
- Automated completion costs ~$0.08-0.18 per PR
- Saves 1-3 hours of manual documentation/improvement work
- Helps improve agent capabilities for future work

**👤 Repository maintainers:** You can add the appropriate label to proceed with merge.`;
