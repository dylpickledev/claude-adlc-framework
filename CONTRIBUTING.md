# Contributing to DA Agent Hub

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the DA Agent Hub! This framework is designed to be adaptable and extensible for any data team's needs.

## üåü How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions Welcome
- **Agent Expertise**: New specialist agents for different data tools or domains
- **Workflow Improvements**: Enhanced scripts or automation patterns
- **Documentation**: Better guides, examples, or template improvements
- **Integration Examples**: Connectors for additional data stack tools
- **Bug Fixes**: Issues with existing functionality

### Getting Started
1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/your-contribution`
3. **Test your changes** in your own environment
4. **Submit a pull request** with clear description

## üîß Development Guidelines

### Agent Development
When creating new specialist agents (`.claude/agents/*.md`):
- Follow the existing agent structure and format
- Include clear expertise areas and example use cases
- Provide tool-specific best practices and patterns
- Ensure agents are framework-agnostic (not company-specific)

### Script Development
For workflow scripts (`scripts/*.sh`):
- Maintain compatibility with the 4-command system
- Include error handling and user feedback
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Test across different environments

### Documentation Standards
- Use clear, actionable language
- Include practical examples
- Maintain consistency with existing documentation style
- Ensure content is organization-agnostic

## üß™ Testing Your Contributions

### Local Testing
Before submitting:
1. Test all new scripts in a clean environment
2. Verify agent interactions work as expected
3. Ensure documentation is accurate and helpful
4. Check that changes don't break existing functionality

### Framework Testing
Use the framework's own structure to test contributions:
```bash
# Test idea capture and organization
./scripts/capture.sh "Test contribution: [your feature]"

# Test project workflow
./scripts/build.sh "test-contribution"

# Verify agent coordination works
claude "test my new agent with existing workflow"

# Complete testing
./scripts/finish.sh "test-contribution"
```
