**How to contribute a skill**:
1. Choose a planned skill from `.claude/skills/README.md`
2. Create skill folder: `.claude/skills/{skill-name}/`
3. Add `skill.md` following the template structure
4. Add templates if needed: `.claude/skills/{skill-name}/templates/`
5. Test on appropriate platforms (dbt Core and/or Cloud)
6. Update `.claude/skills/README.md` to mark as implemented
7. Submit PR

### 3. Improve Documentation
- Fix typos or unclear instructions
- Add examples and use cases

./scripts/setup-submodules.sh

# 4. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# 5. Make your changes
# ... edit files ...

# 6. Test your changes
# For skills: Test on both dbt Core and Cloud if applicable
# For scripts: Run and verify output

# 7. Commit with clear message
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: Add dbt-test-suite-generator skill"

## Skill Development Guide

### Skill Template Structure

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: Brief description of what skill does
version: 1.0.0
platform: ["dbt_core", "dbt_cloud"]  # or ["universal"]
---

# Skill Name

Brief overview.

## Purpose

What problem does this solve? Time savings?

## Usage

Trigger phrases and expected outcomes.

## Workflow Steps

### Step 0: Platform Detection (if platform-specific)
[Use detection libraries]

### Step 1: [Action]
[Detailed instructions]

### Step 2: [Action]
[Detailed instructions]

## Templates

[If skill uses templates, describe them]

## Testing

[How to test this skill]

## Error Handling

[Common errors and solutions]
```

### Detection Library Integration

Always use detection libraries for platform-aware skills:

```markdown
## Step 0: Platform Detection

platform = detect_dbt_platform()  # Use platform-detector.md

IF platform != "dbt_cloud":
  ERROR: "This skill requires dbt Cloud (you're on dbt Core)"
  SUGGEST: [Alternative skill for Core]
  EXIT
```

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Tested on dbt Core (if applicable)
- [ ] Tested on dbt Cloud (if applicable)
- [ ] Tested with small project (<100 models)
- [ ] Tested with large project (>500 models) if using MCP
- [ ] Error messages are clear and helpful
- [ ] Fallback options provided when features unavailable
