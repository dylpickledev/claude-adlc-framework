## Quick Links
- **Research Report**: [tasks/research-findings.md](tasks/research-findings.md)
- **Project Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
- **Current Context**: [context.md](context.md)
- **GitHub Branch**: `feature/ai-memory-system-improvements`

## Project Status

**Status**: ðŸš§ Phase 1 - In Progress
**Started**: 2025-01-14
**Target Completion**: 12 weeks (phased)

### Current Phase: Phase 1 - Token-Aware Memory Loading (Weeks 1-2)
- [ ] Add token counting to all pattern files
- [ ] Implement 20k token budget system
- [ ] Create dynamic relevance scoring
- [ ] Test with realistic memory loads

**Expected Impact**: 40-60% reduction in context noise

## Progress Summary

### Completed
âœ… Comprehensive research on AI memory systems (500+ pages)
âœ… Created research-role agent
âœ… Project setup and documentation
âœ… Feature branch created

### In Progress
ðŸš§ Phase 1 implementation starting

### Upcoming
- Phase 2: Memory Consolidation Pipeline (Weeks 3-4)
- Phase 3: Semantic Search (Weeks 5-6)
- Phase 4: Agent-Specific Memory Scopes (Weeks 7-8)
- Phase 5: Memory Hygiene Automation (Weeks 9-10)
- Phase 6: Cross-Session Pattern Learning (Weeks 11-12)

## Key Decisions

### Decision 1: Anthropic-First Architecture
**Date**: 2025-01-14
**Decision**: Follow Anthropic's official guidance as authoritative source
**Rationale**: Official documentation + cookbook are most validated approaches
**Impact**: Architecture decisions prioritize context engineering over speculation

### Decision 2: Phased Implementation
**Date**: 2025-01-14
**Decision**: 12-week phased approach with validation gates
**Rationale**: Minimize risk, validate each improvement before next phase
**Impact**: Each phase delivers measurable value independently

### Decision 3: Token Budget as Foundation
**Date**: 2025-01-14
**Decision**: Start with token-aware loading (Phase 1)
**Rationale**: Highest ROI, lowest risk, enables all other improvements
**Impact**: Foundation for semantic search and consolidation

## Success Metrics

### Efficiency Gains (Target: 12 weeks)
- 40% reduction in context tokens loaded
- 50% reduction in time to find relevant patterns
- 80% reduction in manual memory curation time

### Quality Improvements
- >85% semantic search accuracy
- >80% pattern success rate
- Zero high-value pattern loss during rotation

### Agent Performance
- 50% reduction in specialist context noise
- >90% specialist response relevance
- >60% of tasks leverage existing patterns

## Team & Roles

**Primary**: research-role (comprehensive research and synthesis)
**Support**: data-architect-role (architecture decisions), project-manager-role (roadmap validation)

## Related Work

**Previous Memory Issues**: "Remember for next time" failures due to context rot
**Root Cause**: No token budgeting, static file loading, no semantic retrieval
**This Project**: Systematic fix based on Anthropic guidance + academic research
