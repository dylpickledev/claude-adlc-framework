# AI Memory System Improvements - Working Context

## Current State

**Branch**: `feature/ai-memory-system-improvements`
**Phase**: Phase 1 - Token-Aware Memory Loading
**Status**: Starting implementation
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-14

## Active Work

### Phase 1: Token-Aware Memory Loading (Current)

**Goal**: Implement token counting and budget system to reduce context noise by 40-60%

**Tasks**:
1. Create token counting utility
2. Implement memory budget system
3. Build relevance scoring
4. Add token metadata to existing patterns
5. Test with realistic loads
6. Measure before/after metrics

**Current Focus**: Setting up foundation scripts and utilities

## Key Findings from Research

### The Core Problem
**Context Rot**: As token count increases, recall accuracy decreases due to finite attention budget (n² pairwise token relationships).

**Current DA Agent Hub Issues**:
1. No token budgeting - all patterns loaded
2. Static file-based memory - no semantic retrieval
3. Flat 30-day window - no consolidation
4. Manual pattern application - no automatic matching
5. Global patterns for specialists - high context noise
6. Manual maintenance - no automation
7. No security sanitization

### The Solution (Validated by Research)

**Anthropic's Guidance**: "Find the smallest possible set of high-signal tokens that maximize the likelihood of desired outcomes"

**Academic Research (A-MEM)**: 6x improvement using dynamic, multi-level memory (1,200-2,500 tokens vs. 16,900 baseline)

**Phased Approach**:
1. Token-aware loading (foundation)
2. Memory consolidation (prevent loss)
3. Semantic search (intelligent retrieval)
4. Agent scoping (reduce noise)
5. Hygiene automation (maintenance)
6. Cross-session learning (pattern leverage)

## Technical Decisions

### Decision: Use tiktoken for Token Counting
**Rationale**: Official tokenizer for Claude models (cl100k_base encoding)
**Implementation**: Python utility script
**Status**: To be implemented

### Decision: 20k Token Budget Initial
**Rationale**: Conservative starting point (10% of 200k context window)
**Tuning**: Will optimize based on metrics
**Status**: To be configured

### Decision: Local Semantic Search (ChromaDB)
**Rationale**: No cloud dependency, privacy-preserving, fast
**Phase**: Phase 3 (weeks 5-6)
**Status**: Future work

### Decision: Three-Tier Memory Hierarchy
**Rationale**: Aligns with A-MEM research (short/mid/long term)
**Phase**: Phase 2 (weeks 3-4)
**Status**: Future work

## Blockers & Risks

### Current Blockers
None - starting fresh implementation

### Identified Risks
1. **Complexity overhead**: Mitigated by phased approach with validation gates
2. **Performance concerns**: Mitigated by async processing, performance budgets
3. **Memory synchronization**: Mitigated by atomic writes, git versioning

## Metrics to Track

### Before Phase 1 (Baseline)
- [ ] Count total tokens in `.claude/memory/patterns/`
- [ ] Count total patterns loaded per agent invocation
- [ ] Measure time to find relevant patterns (manual)
- [ ] Count manual memory curation tasks per week

### After Phase 1 (Target)
- [ ] 40-60% reduction in context tokens loaded
- [ ] Relevance scoring accuracy >80%
- [ ] No regression in pattern access
- [ ] Token budget respected in 100% of loads

### Success Criteria
✅ Token counting functional
✅ Budget system enforced
✅ 40-60% context reduction
✅ No pattern access regression
✅ Documentation complete

## Next Steps (Immediate)

1. **Create Phase 1 implementation plan** with detailed subtasks
2. **Build token counting utility** (Python script)
3. **Implement memory budget system** (Python class)
4. **Add relevance scoring** (recency + usage + context)
5. **Measure baseline metrics** (before implementation)
6. **Test with realistic loads** (validate budget works)
7. **Measure after metrics** (validate success criteria)
8. **Update documentation** (patterns, usage, config)

## Notes

**Memory Failure Examples from User**:
- "remember this for next time" → consistently fails
- Patterns exist but not retrieved
- Context noise drowns out relevant patterns

**Root Cause Identified**:
- All patterns loaded = context rot
- No relevance scoring = noise vs. signal
- Static files = no semantic "have we seen this?"

**This Project Fixes**:
- Token budgeting → only relevant patterns
- Relevance scoring → signal prioritized
- Semantic search (Phase 3) → "have we seen this?" works
