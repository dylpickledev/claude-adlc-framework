## Key Research Findings

### 1. Architecture Pattern (Anthropic-Validated)

**✅ CORRECT**: Role → Specialist (specialist uses MCP + expertise)
```
Role Agent (primary)
    ↓ Delegates when confidence <0.60 OR expertise needed
Specialist (expert)
    ├─ Uses MCP tools (data access)
    ├─ Applies domain expertise (synthesis, validation)
    └─ Returns validated recommendation
Role Agent
    └─ Executes with confidence
```

**❌ INCORRECT**: Role → MCP tools directly (data without expertise)
```
Role Agent
    ↓ Uses MCP tools directly
    ↓ Interprets without expertise
    ↓ 💥 Production errors
```

### 2. Why Specialists Are Essential (Even With MCP)

**MCP tools provide** (DATA ACCESS):
- Infrastructure state queries (what's deployed)
- Documentation lookup (what AWS docs say)
- Best practices retrieval (what Well-Architected recommends)

**Specialists provide** (EXPERTISE):
- Architectural synthesis (how to combine services)
- Trade-off analysis (cost vs performance vs security)
- Decision validation (is this the right approach?)
- Error prevention (what could go wrong?)
- Quality assurance (will this work in production?)

**Together**: MCP data + Specialist expertise = Informed, correct decisions

### 3. Token Cost vs Error Cost (The ROI)

**Anthropic research**:
- Multi-agent systems: 15x more tokens
- But: Significantly better outcomes

**Real-world impact**:
- Token cost: $0.50 specialist consultation
- Error cost: $500-$5,000 (downtime, debugging, lost revenue)
- Security incident: $10,000+ (breach response)
- Cost overrun: $100-$1,000/month (unoptimized infrastructure)

**ROI**: 100x-1000x return on token investment

### 4. Your Priority Alignment

**You stated**: "More important to be correct than fast" ✅

**Architecture delivers**:
- Correctness-first (specialist validation)
- Error prevention (expert oversight)
- Quality outcomes (validated recommendations)
- Worth the 15x token cost

### 5. MCP Server Landscape

**Discovered**: 120+ MCP servers across categories
**Relevant**: ~40 servers for DA stack
**Configured**: 6 servers (dbt, Snowflake, freshservice, AWS suite)
**Recommended**: 8 more for Week 1 (github, slack, git, filesystem, etc.)
**Custom Needed**: 4 critical (Orchestra, Prefect, Great Expectations, Tableau Enhanced)

## Critical Architecture Decisions

### Decision 1: Role → Specialist (with MCP) Pattern

**Research-backed rationale**:
- Anthropic guidance: Multi-agent systems 15x tokens but significantly better outcomes
- MCP tools provide DATA, specialists provide EXPERTISE
- Data without expertise = guessing
- Tools + expertise = informed decisions

**Implementation**:
- Roles delegate domain-specific work to specialists
- Specialists use MCP tools + expertise for validation
- Return expert-validated recommendations

**User priority alignment**: Correctness > Speed ✅

### Decision 2: Merge cloud-manager-role into aws-expert

**Rationale**:
- cloud-manager-role was attempting direct MCP usage (incorrect pattern)
- Simpler to have single AWS infrastructure specialist
- Matches pattern: roles delegate to specialists, not become specialists

**Result**:
- aws-expert is THE AWS infrastructure specialist
- All roles delegate AWS work to aws-expert
- aws-expert uses aws-api, aws-docs, aws-knowledge with expertise

### Decision 3: Specialist Revival Priority

**HIGH Priority** (Week 1-4):
1. dbt-expert - Transformation core (Week 1)
2. snowflake-expert - Warehouse optimization (Week 1)
3. orchestra-expert - Orchestration (Week 3)
4. prefect-expert - Python workflows (Week 3)

**MEDIUM Priority** (Week 5-8):
5. tableau-expert - BI optimization (Week 5)
6. dlthub-expert - Data ingestion (Week 5)
7. github-sleuth-expert - Repository analysis (Week 7)
8. documentation-expert - Standards (Week 7)

**LOW Priority** (Week 9-12):
9. react-expert - Development patterns (Week 7)
10. streamlit-expert - Streamlit apps (Week 7)

### Decision 4: Custom MCP Development (CRITICAL PATH)

**Required custom MCPs** (no official servers exist):
1. **orchestra-mcp** - CRITICAL (Week 4 development)
   - Workflow orchestration state queries
   - Pipeline monitoring and alerting
   - Integration with Prefect, dbt, Airbyte

2. **prefect-mcp** - CRITICAL (Week 4 development)
   - Prefect flow state and execution
   - Task monitoring and logs
   - Integration with Orchestra

3. **great-expectations-mcp** - HIGH (Week 6 development)
   - Data quality validation suite access
   - Test suite configuration
   - Validation results

4. **tableau-enhanced-mcp** - HIGH (Weeks 9-10 development)
   - Official tableau-mcp too basic
   - Need dashboard performance analysis
   - Workbook structure parsing

## Key Insights to Remember

### 1. The Golden Rule
> **When in doubt, delegate to specialist.**
>
> Delegating = Simple, safe, correct
> Direct MCP usage without expertise = Complex, risky, error-prone

### 2. MCP Tools ≠ Expertise
- MCP provides **data** (what exists, what docs say)
- Specialists provide **expertise** (how to interpret, what to do)
- Together = Informed decisions
- Separately = Guessing

### 3. Token Cost is Worth It
- 15x tokens for specialist = $0.50 vs $0.03
- But error prevention = $500-$5,000 savings
- ROI: 100x-1000x return

### 4. Correctness Priority Validated
Your stated priority ("More important to be correct than fast") is **exactly right** per Anthropic research.

### 5. Proven Pattern
- DA Agent Hub: 50-70% efficiency gains with role-based
- Anthropic: 90% improvement with multi-agent
- AWS Labs: Specialist delegation recommended
- Industry: Standard pattern across data teams

---

## Environment Requirements

### Prerequisites (Already Have)
- ✅ Python 3.13.7 (meets 3.10+ requirement)
- ✅ uv 0.7.12 (package manager)
- ✅ AWS credentials (default profile, us-west-2)

### Tokens Needed (Week 1)
- ⬜ GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN (github-mcp)
- ⬜ SLACK_BOT_TOKEN (slack-mcp)
- ⬜ SLACK_TEAM_ID (slack-mcp)

### Optional (Later Phases)
- ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN (Week 2-3, for business-context)
- NOTION_API_TOKEN (Week 5-6, for documentation)
- TABLEAU_SERVER_URL + credentials (Week 5-6, if using Tableau Server)

---

## Success Criteria

### Technical Validation
- ✅ All MCP servers connect successfully
- ✅ Specialists can invoke MCP tools
- ✅ Delegation patterns work end-to-end
- ✅ Role → Specialist → MCP → Result flows correctly

### Quality Validation
- ✅ Specialist recommendations are correct (>90%)
- ✅ Production deployments succeed (>90%)
- ✅ Errors reduced vs direct MCP usage (>30% reduction)
- ✅ Time to resolution improved (despite token cost)

### Business Validation
- ✅ Team understands architecture
- ✅ Team can effectively delegate to specialists
- ✅ Operational incidents reduced (>40%)
- ✅ Documentation quality improved (>90% completeness)

---

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk 1: Custom MCP Development Delays
**Impact**: Orchestra/Prefect specialists can't be used (blocks Week 3-4)
**Mitigation**:
- Start custom MCP development in Week 2 (parallel with role updates)
- Have fallback: Use bash commands if MCPs not ready
- Prioritize orchestra-mcp (most critical)

### Risk 2: Team Adoption
**Impact**: Team continues using direct MCP patterns (incorrect)
**Mitigation**:
- Comprehensive training (Week 2)
- Clear documentation (.claude/agents/README.md)
- Success metrics tracking
- Regular reviews and feedback

### Risk 3: Token Cost Concerns
**Impact**: Hesitation to use specialist pattern due to cost
**Mitigation**:
- Track error cost savings (quantify ROI)
- Demonstrate quality improvements
- Show time-to-resolution improvements
- Measure business impact (uptime, reliability)

## Questions & Answers (For Future Sessions)

### Q: "Should I use MCP tools directly or delegate to specialist?"
**A**: Delegate to specialist when confidence <0.60 OR expertise needed. Specialist uses MCP + expertise.

### Q: "Why is the token cost worth it?"
**A**: 15x tokens ($0.50) prevents errors costing $500-$5,000+. ROI: 100x-1000x.

### Q: "Which specialist should I consult for X task?"
**A**: See `docs/mcp-research-2025/role-specialist-delegation-framework.md` decision trees.

### Q: "What MCP servers does X specialist use?"
**A**: See `docs/mcp-research-2025/specialist-mcp-integration-plan.md` complete mappings.

### Q: "How do I add a new MCP server?"
**A**: See `docs/mcp-research-2025/mcp-server-catalog.md` installation instructions.

### Q: "What's the status of custom MCP development?"
**A**: Orchestra-mcp and Prefect-mcp scheduled for Week 4. Specs to be designed Week 3.

### Q: "Can I skip specialist consultation to save time?"
**A**: NO. Correctness > Speed. Anthropic research: 15x tokens = significantly better outcomes.
