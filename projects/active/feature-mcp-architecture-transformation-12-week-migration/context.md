# Working Context: MCP Architecture Transformation - 12 Week Migration

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-07 15:30 (Week 2 COMPLETE)
**Current Phase:** Week 3 Planning - Custom MCP Development
**Current Focus:** Orchestration layer specialist revival (orchestra-expert, prefect-expert)

## Migration Progress

### ✅ Week 0: Preparation (COMPLETE)
- Research and architecture design (39 sources)
- AWS MCP integration
- Documentation creation (15 files, 160KB)

### ✅ Week 1 Days 1-2: Foundation (COMPLETE)
- Agent folder organization (roles/, specialists/, deprecated/)
- Specialist revival (dbt-expert, snowflake-expert)
- MCP server configuration (11 servers)
- Template creation (role-template.md, specialist-template.md)
- 3 roles updated with delegation protocols

### ✅ Week 1 Day 3: GitHub MCP (COMPLETE)
- ✅ GitHub PAT configured in .claude/mcp.json (using 1Password env var)
- ✅ github-mcp enabled (disabled: false)
- ✅ Scopes: repo, read:org, read:project

### ✅ Week 1 Day 4: Environment Setup & Slack MCP (COMPLETE)
- ✅ Identified MCP startup timing issue (env vars not available to GUI-launched apps)
- ✅ Implemented solution: Created `~/.zshenv` to load 1Password secrets system-wide
- ✅ Fixed SLACK_TEAM_ID loading bug (added --reveal flag)
- ✅ Added 24-hour caching to reduce 1Password API calls (~500ms improvement)
- ✅ Slack bot token & team ID configured in .claude/mcp.json
- ✅ slack-mcp enabled (disabled: false)
- ✅ All environment variables verified (SLACK_BOT_TOKEN, SLACK_TEAM_ID, GITHUB_PAT, AWS, Snowflake, dbt)
- ✅ Created comprehensive troubleshooting documentation
- ✅ Committed dotfiles improvements (caching + credential management docs)

### ✅ Week 1 Day 5: MCP Testing & GitHub Sleuth Revival (COMPLETE)
**Completed**:
- ✅ Fixed .env file UTF-8 encoding issue (removed invalid character)
- ✅ Removed non-existent MCP servers (git, aws-knowledge) from config
- ✅ **SOLVED Snowflake MCP** - Created wrapper script solution
  - Issue: Claude Code doesn't expand `${VAR}` in args array
  - Solution: `scripts/launch-snowflake-mcp.sh` injects password at runtime
  - Config: Hardcoded values in YAML, only password injected dynamically
  - Test: Successfully connected and initialized tools
- ✅ **MCP SERVER COMPREHENSIVE TESTING** - All 8 servers tested and operational (100%)
  - dbt-mcp, snowflake-mcp, aws-api, aws-docs, github, slack, filesystem, sequential-thinking
  - All authentication via 1Password working correctly
  - Comprehensive test results documented in PR #91
- ✅ **GITHUB SLEUTH EXPERT REVIVAL** - Moved from deprecated to specialists
  - Full GitHub MCP integration
  - Smart repository context resolution
  - Investigation workflow with MCP examples
  - Cross-repository pattern analysis capabilities
- ✅ **SMART CONTEXT RESOLUTION SYSTEM** - Automatic owner/repo detection
  - Python resolver (`scripts/resolve-repo-context.py`) - 200+ lines
  - Bash helper (`scripts/get-repo-owner.sh`)
  - Pattern documentation (`.claude/memory/patterns/github-repo-context-resolution.md`)
  - 13+ repositories resolvable from config/repositories.json
  - Integrated into dbt-expert and github-sleuth-expert
- ✅ **DOCUMENTATION UPDATES**
  - README.md: Added Week 1 completion status section
  - SECURITY.md: Added MCP integration section
  - CLAUDE.md: Added smart context resolution section
  - All specialist agents updated with new patterns
- ✅ **PR #91 CREATED**: https://github.com/graniterock/da-agent-hub/pull/91
  - 10 files changed, 1,047 insertions, 238 deletions
  - Comprehensive testing results documented
  - Ready for review and merge

**Week 1 Metrics**:
- ✅ MCP Servers: 8/8 operational (100%)
- ✅ Specialists: 4 operational (aws-expert, dbt-expert, snowflake-expert, github-sleuth-expert)
- ✅ Context Resolution: 13+ repositories
- ✅ Documentation: 3 new files, 4 updated
- ✅ Lines of Code: ~650 new lines

### 🎯 WEEK 1 COMPLETE - ALL DELIVERABLES MET

### ✅ Week 2: Role Agent Integration (COMPLETE - 2025-10-07)
**Completed**:
- ✅ **10/10 ROLE AGENTS UPDATED** - Delegation frameworks integrated
  - analytics-engineer-role, data-engineer-role, bi-developer-role
  - ui-ux-developer-role, data-architect-role, business-analyst-role
  - qa-engineer-role, project-manager-role, dba-role
  - role-template.md (reference implementation)
- ✅ **DELEGATION DECISION FRAMEWORK** - Standardized across all role agents
  - 5-step protocol: Assess → Prepare → Delegate → Validate → Execute
  - Confidence threshold: <0.60 triggers specialist delegation
  - Specialist coordination patterns (single-domain, cross-domain, tech selection)
- ✅ **MCP INTEGRATION** - Role agents map to specialist agents with MCP servers
  - Role agents: 80% independent work, 20% specialist consultation
  - Specialist agents: Deep expertise with MCP tool access
  - Correctness-first philosophy (15x token cost justified)
- ✅ **DOCUMENTATION COMPLETE** - WEEK2_COMPLETE_2025-10-07.md created
  - 10 files modified, ~1,200 lines added
  - All agents reference appropriate specialists
  - Template standardization complete

**Week 2 Metrics**:
- ✅ Role Agents: 10/10 updated (100%)
- ✅ Delegation Frameworks: 10/10 implemented (100%)
- ✅ Time: 7 days (on target)
- ✅ Quality: High (all agents validated)

### 🎯 WEEK 2 COMPLETE - READY FOR WEEK 3

## Next Actions

**Immediate (This Session)**:
1. ✅ Update context.md with Week 2 completion
2. ⏳ Commit data-architect delegation framework
3. ⏳ Create PR #XX for Week 2 completion
4. ⏳ Merge PR to main

**Week 3: Orchestration Specialists (5-7 days) - DECISION REQUIRED**:

**Option A: Custom MCP Development (Preferred)**
1. Design orchestra-mcp specification (REST API integration)
2. Develop custom orchestra-mcp server (Python/TypeScript)
3. Design prefect-mcp specification (Prefect Cloud API)
4. Develop custom prefect-mcp server (Python/TypeScript)
5. Test MCP servers with Claude Code
6. Revive orchestra-expert and prefect-expert with MCP integration
7. Document orchestration delegation patterns

**Option B: Specialist Revival with Existing Tools (Fallback)**
1. Revive orchestra-expert using WebFetch, Bash, Read/Grep
2. Revive prefect-expert using existing tools
3. Document manual research patterns
4. Plan custom MCP development for future phase

**Recommended**: Option A (Custom MCP development) - More sustainable long-term

**Week 4-5: BI and Ingestion Specialists**:
