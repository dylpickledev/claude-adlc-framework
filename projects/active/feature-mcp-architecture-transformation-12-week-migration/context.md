- MCP server configuration (11 servers)
- Template creation (role-template.md, specialist-template.md)
- 3 roles updated with delegation protocols

### ✅ Week 1 Day 3: GitHub MCP (COMPLETE)
- ✅ GitHub PAT configured in .claude/mcp.json (using 1Password env var)
- ✅ github-mcp enabled (disabled: false)

### ✅ Week 1 Day 4: Environment Setup & Slack MCP (COMPLETE)
- ✅ Identified MCP startup timing issue (env vars not available to GUI-launched apps)
- ✅ Implemented solution: Created `~/.zshenv` to load 1Password secrets system-wide
- ✅ Fixed SLACK_TEAM_ID loading bug (added --reveal flag)
- ✅ Added 24-hour caching to reduce 1Password API calls (~500ms improvement)
- ✅ Slack bot token & team ID configured in .claude/mcp.json

  - Comprehensive test results documented in PR #91
- ✅ **GITHUB SLEUTH EXPERT REVIVAL** - Moved from deprecated to specialists
  - Full GitHub MCP integration
  - Smart repository context resolution
  - Investigation workflow with MCP examples

  - Pattern documentation (`.claude/memory/patterns/github-repo-context-resolution.md`)
  - 13+ repositories resolvable from config/repositories.json
  - Integrated into dbt-expert and github-sleuth-expert
- ✅ **DOCUMENTATION UPDATES**

2. ⏳ Commit data-architect delegation framework
3. ⏳ Create PR #XX for Week 2 completion
4. ⏳ Merge PR to main

**Week 3: Orchestration Specialists (5-7 days) - DECISION REQUIRED**:

**Option A: Custom MCP Development (Preferred)**
1. Design orchestra-mcp specification (REST API integration)
2. Develop custom orchestra-mcp server (Python/TypeScript)
3. Design prefect-mcp specification (Prefect Cloud API)
4. Develop custom prefect-mcp server (Python/TypeScript)
5. Test MCP servers with Claude Code
6. Revive orchestra-expert and prefect-expert with MCP integration
7. Document orchestration delegation patterns

**Option B: Specialist Revival with Existing Tools (Fallback)**
1. Revive orchestra-expert using WebFetch, Bash, Read/Grep
2. Revive prefect-expert using existing tools
3. Document manual research patterns
