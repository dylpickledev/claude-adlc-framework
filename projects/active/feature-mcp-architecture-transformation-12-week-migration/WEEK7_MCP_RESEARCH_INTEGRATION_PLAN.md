## Recommended Next Steps

I'll walk you through each recommendation with decision points you need to weigh in on.

---

## DECISION POINT #1: Testing Strategy

### Option A: Comprehensive MCP Testing (Recommended)
**Time**: 1-2 hours
**Risk**: Low - validates everything works before building on it

**Test Each Specialist's Primary Tools**:
```bash
# dbt-expert primary tools
mcp__dbt-mcp__list_metrics
mcp__dbt-mcp__get_all_models  # May be large - use cautiously
mcp__dbt-mcp__get_mart_models  # Safer alternative

# snowflake-expert primary tools
mcp__snowflake-mcp__list_objects object_type="table" database_name="ANALYTICS_DW" schema_name="PROD_SALES_DM"
mcp__snowflake-mcp__run_snowflake_query statement="SELECT CURRENT_USER(), CURRENT_ROLE(), CURRENT_WAREHOUSE()"

# aws-expert primary tools
mcp__aws-api__call_aws cli_command="aws sts get-caller-identity"
mcp__aws-docs__search_documentation search_phrase="ECS Fargate best practices" limit=3

# github-sleuth-expert primary tools
mcp__github__search_repositories query="org:graniterock language:Python" perPage=5
mcp__github__list_issues owner="graniterock" repo="da-agent-hub" state="open" per_page=5

# documentation-expert primary tools
mcp__filesystem__list_directory path="knowledge"
mcp__filesystem__search_files path="knowledge" pattern="*.md"
```

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Validates confidence scores are accurate
- ‚úÖ Catches authentication/permission issues early
- ‚úÖ Confirms known issues are documented correctly
- ‚úÖ Builds confidence before production use

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå Takes 1-2 hours
- ‚ùå May discover issues requiring fixes

### Option B: Skip Testing - Trust Documentation
**Time**: 0 hours
**Risk**: Medium - might hit issues during actual specialist use

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Move faster to role agent updates
- ‚úÖ Fix issues as discovered in production

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå Unknown issues may block specialist work
- ‚ùå Confidence scores unvalidated

### üéØ Question for You:
**Should we test MCP tools now (Option A) or trust the documentation and fix issues as discovered (Option B)?**

---

## DECISION POINT #2: Role Agent Update Priority

### Context
You have **10 role agents** that need MCP access pattern updates. I recommend a phased approach based on MCP usage intensity.

### Proposed Priority Tiers

**Tier 1 - High MCP Usage (Update First)**:
1. **analytics-engineer-role**: Heavy dbt-mcp + snowflake-mcp usage
2. **data-architect-role**: Sequential-thinking integration for strategic decisions
3. **qa-engineer-role**: Filesystem + sequential-thinking for comprehensive testing

**Tier 2 - Moderate MCP Usage**:
4. **data-engineer-role**: GitHub + filesystem for pipeline work
5. **project-manager-role**: Slack + GitHub for coordination
6. **business-analyst-role**: Slack + sequential-thinking for requirements

**Tier 3 - Light MCP Usage**:
7. **ui-ux-developer-role**: GitHub only (delegates AWS to aws-expert)
8. **bi-developer-role**: dbt-mcp for metrics (delegates complex to dbt-expert)
9. **dba-role**: Snowflake-mcp (delegates complex to snowflake-expert)

**Tier 4 - Minimal Direct MCP**:
10. **Any remaining roles**: Primarily delegate to specialists

### üéØ Questions for You:

**Q1**: Do you agree with the Tier 1 priority (analytics-engineer, data-architect, qa-engineer)?
- These have clearest MCP usage patterns
- Most value from direct MCP access
- Alternative: Different priority order?

**Q2**: Should we update all Tier 1 in parallel or sequentially?
- **Parallel** (all 3 at once): Faster (1-2 hours total), requires focus
- **Sequential** (one at a time): Slower (3-4 hours total), more methodical

**Q3**: Should we stop after Tier 1 or continue through all tiers?
- **Stop after Tier 1**: Test integration, gather feedback, iterate
- **Complete all tiers**: Full coverage now, test everything later

---

## DECISION POINT #3: Sequential Thinking Integration

### Context
Research shows **sequential-thinking-mcp has 15x token cost but significantly better outcomes** for complex problems (Anthropic validated).

**Recommended high-value integration**:
- data-architect-role (architecture decisions)
- qa-engineer-role (root cause analysis)
- business-analyst-role (stakeholder alignment)

### Integration Options

**Option A: Integrated Guidance (Recommended)**
Add to each high-value role agent:
```markdown
## Complex Problem-Solving Protocol

**Use sequential-thinking-mcp when:**
- Architecture decisions (confidence < 0.85)
- Root cause analysis requiring hypothesis testing
- Stakeholder requirement conflicts requiring exploration
- Multi-phase planning with uncertainty

**Pattern**: Structured reasoning ‚Üí hypothesis ‚Üí verification ‚Üí decision
**Cost**: 15x token usage
**Benefit**: Significantly better outcomes (Anthropic research validated)
```

**Option B: Leave as Optional**
- Agents aware of sequential-thinking but don't have specific guidance
- Use it organically when needed
- Document patterns as discovered

### üéØ Question for You:
**Should we add explicit sequential-thinking guidance to Tier 1 role agents (Option A) or keep it optional (Option B)?**

My recommendation: Option A for data-architect and qa-engineer (high complexity roles), Option B for analytics-engineer (more straightforward work)

---

## DECISION POINT #4: Documentation Organization

### Current State
We have MCP research scattered across multiple locations:
- Root level: `dbt-mcp-capabilities-research.md`, `aws-api-mcp-server-comprehensive-documentation.md`
- `knowledge/mcp-servers/`: aws-docs documentation
- `.claude/memory/research/`: github-mcp documentation
- `knowledge/da-agent-hub/development/`: filesystem, sequential-thinking docs
- `knowledge/da-agent-hub/mcp-servers/`: slack-mcp docs

### Consolidation Options

**Option A: Centralize in `knowledge/mcp-servers/`**
- Move all MCP research to single location
- Consistent structure: `<server>-capabilities.md`, `<server>-integration-guide.md`
- Easier to find and maintain

**Option B: Keep Current Structure**
- Leave files where created
- Update index/README to point to all locations
- Less reorganization work

**Option C: Hybrid - Keep Research, Centralize Guides**
- Research docs stay in `.claude/memory/research/`
- Integration guides move to `knowledge/mcp-servers/`
- Clear separation: research vs operational reference

### üéØ Question for You:
**How should we organize MCP documentation going forward (A, B, or C)?**

My recommendation: Option C - clear separation between historical research and operational guides

---

## DECISION POINT #5: Week 7 Scope

### Context
Original spec shows Weeks 7-12 as "Production Deployment + Final Polish". We just completed significant MCP research work.

### Scope Options

**Option A: Week 7 = MCP Integration Completion**
Focus entirely on integrating MCP research:
1. Test MCP tools (validate confidence scores)
2. Update Tier 1 role agents (3 agents)
3. Create MCP quick reference cards (4 cards)
4. Document first cross-tool integration patterns
5. Validate in small production use case

**Timeline**: 3-5 days
**Benefit**: Solid MCP foundation before moving forward

**Option B: Week 7 = Remaining Specialists + MCP Testing**
Split focus between new specialists and MCP integration:
1. Test MCP tools (validation)
2. Update Tier 1 role agents
3. Revive remaining 2-5 Tier 1 specialists (tableau, dlthub, orchestra, prefect, ui-ux)
4. Create specialist templates for Tier 2/3

**Timeline**: 5-7 days
**Benefit**: Faster toward 17+ specialist goal

**Option C: Week 7 = Deploy Issue #105 Optimizations**
Shift focus to business value delivery:
1. Quick MCP validation only
2. Deploy $949K optimization opportunities from Issue #105
3. Measure actual business impact
4. Use learnings to refine MCP integration

**Timeline**: 5-7 days
**Benefit**: Immediate business value, real-world validation

### üéØ Question for You:
**What should Week 7 focus on (A, B, or C)?**

My recommendation: **Option A** - Solid MCP foundation enables everything else. Without validated MCP integration, specialists can't function properly.

## DECISION POINT #6: Custom MCP Development Timing

### Context
Week 3-4 original plan called for custom MCP development (Orchestra, Prefect). This is complex work.

### Timing Options

**Option A: Build Custom MCPs Now (Week 8-9)**
- Develop orchestra-mcp (Orchestra REST API integration)
- Develop prefect-mcp (Prefect Cloud API integration)
- Test and document
- Revive orchestra-expert and prefect-expert with MCP access

**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks (significant development)
**Complexity**: HIGH - custom MCP server development

**Option B: Defer Custom MCPs - Use Existing Tools**
- Revive orchestra-expert and prefect-expert with WebFetch, Bash, API calls
- Document manual patterns
- Plan custom MCP for future phase (post-12 weeks)

**Timeline**: 1 week for specialist revival
**Complexity**: MEDIUM - use existing tools creatively

**Option C: Evaluate Necessity First**
- Test if WebFetch + API calls are sufficient
- Measure pain points and friction
- Decide custom MCP value vs development cost
- Build only if ROI clear

**Timeline**: 1 week evaluation, then decide
**Complexity**: LOW initially, scales based on findings

### üéØ Question for You:
**Should we build custom MCPs for Orchestra/Prefect (A), defer to post-migration (B), or evaluate first (C)?**

My recommendation: **Option C** - Validate the need before committing 2-3 weeks of development. WebFetch + API calls might be sufficient.
