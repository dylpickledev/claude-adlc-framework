# Week 3 Specialist Validation Report

**Date**: 2025-10-07
**Phase**: Week 3 - Specialist Quality Validation
**Approach**: Working with existing tools (defer custom MCP development)

## Executive Summary

Validated 13 existing specialists for production readiness. Found 3 tiers of quality:
- **Tier 1 (Production-ready)**: 7 specialists with complete structure
- **Tier 2 (Functional, needs alignment)**: 3 specialists missing MCP awareness sections
- **Tier 3 (Needs work)**: 3 specialists with minimal structure

**Recommendation**: Focus on Tier 1 specialists for Week 3 delegation testing. Update Tier 2/3 as needed for specific use cases.

## Week 3 Testing Plan

### Immediate Testing (Tier 1 Specialists)

**Test 1: Single-Domain Delegation**
- **Scenario**: Data engineer needs Orchestra pipeline analysis
- **Flow**: data-engineer-role → orchestra-expert
- **Success**: Expert provides pipeline recommendations using Read/Grep/WebFetch
- **Measure**: Time to recommendation, quality of analysis

**Test 2: Cross-Domain Delegation**
- **Scenario**: Analytics engineer optimizing dbt model performance
- **Flow**: analytics-engineer-role → dbt-expert → snowflake-expert
- **Success**: Sequential delegation works, specialists coordinate
- **Measure**: Recommendation quality, cross-specialist synthesis

**Test 3: Infrastructure Work**
- **Scenario**: UI/UX developer deploying React app to AWS
- **Flow**: ui-ux-developer-role → aws-expert
- **Success**: Deployment guidance using aws-api MCP
- **Measure**: Deployment success rate, time to deployment

### Deferred Testing (Tier 2/3)

### Future MCP Development (Deferred)
- ⏸️ orchestra-mcp: Custom development needed (Week 5-6)
- ⏸️ prefect-mcp: Custom development needed (Week 5-6)
- ⏸️ Great Expectations MCP: Optional enhancement (Week 8+)

## Recommendations

### Week 3 Actions
1. ✅ **Test Tier 1 specialists** with real delegation scenarios
2. ⏳ **Validate delegation pattern** works end-to-end
3. ⏳ **Measure quality improvements** vs direct role work
4. ⏳ **Document findings** for continuous improvement

### Week 4-5 Actions (If Needed)
1. Update Tier 2 specialists with MCP awareness sections
2. Validate react-expert content and structure
3. Add confidence levels to all specialists
4. Document production-validated patterns

### Custom MCP Development (Deferred to Week 6+)
- **orchestra-mcp**: REST API integration for Orchestra workflows
- **prefect-mcp**: Prefect Cloud API integration
- **Rationale**: Specialists work NOW with existing tools, MCPs enhance later
