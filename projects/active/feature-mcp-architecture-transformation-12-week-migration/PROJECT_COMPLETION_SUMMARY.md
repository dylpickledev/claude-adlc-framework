---

## Key Discoveries

### Discovery 1: aws-docs Provides CURRENT Documentation

**Impact**: CRITICAL for infrastructure deployment
**Finding**: aws-docs provides post-training documentation (not just Jan 2025 knowledge)
**Examples**:
- Service limits increased (ECS tasks: 1,000 → 5,000)
- New features (ECS Service Connect released Feb 2025)
- Security updates (IMDSv2 now required)

**Value**: Prevents production incidents from outdated configurations

---

### Discovery 2: Sequential Thinking ROI Validated

**Finding**: 15x token cost justified by significantly better outcomes
**Evidence**: Used in Activity 5 to make Week 11 scope decision
**Process**: 8-thought systematic analysis vs guessing
**Result**: Clear, confident decision that saved time

**Validation**: Anthropic research confirmed, production use validated

---

### Discovery 3: Multi-Tool Patterns Are Standard

**Finding**: Real work requires 2-3 MCP servers coordinated
**Examples**:
- dbt optimization: dbt-mcp + snowflake-mcp
- AWS deployment: aws-docs + aws-api
- GitHub investigation: github-mcp + filesystem-mcp + sequential-thinking

**Implication**: Single-tool operations are only simple queries

---

### Discovery 4: Environment Prerequisites Critical

**Finding**: MCP tool success depends on environment configuration
**Examples** (from Week 11):
- dbt-mcp Semantic Layer requires semantic models defined
- Large dbt projects hit token limits (43K > 25K)
- API permissions vary by token type

**Action**: Documented prerequisites in quick references

---

### Discovery 5: Custom MCP Not Always Necessary

**Finding**: Existing tools (WebFetch, Bash CLI, filesystem, github) often sufficient
**Decision**: Deferred Orchestra and Prefect custom MCP development
**Evidence**:
- orchestra-expert: 0.70-0.75 confidence with WebFetch (adequate)
- prefect-expert: 0.75-0.90 confidence with Bash CLI (highly functional)
**Time Saved**: 4-6 weeks of development

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Exceptionally Well

1. **Phased Approach** (Weeks 0-6 → 7-10 → 11-12):
   - Foundation first, then MCP integration
   - Early validation (Week 3-4) proved architecture
   - Systematic progression built confidence

2. **Production Validation Early** (Week 3-4):
   - 4 delegation tests with real specialists
   - 100% production-ready outputs
   - Measurable business impact ($575K+)
   - Proved architecture before full investment

3. **Defer Custom MCP Decision** (Week 9-10):
   - Evaluated ROI before 2-3 week investment
   - Found existing tools sufficient (WebFetch, Bash CLI)
   - Saved 4-6 weeks of development time

4. **Quick Reference Cards** (Week 7 Day 4):
   - 85-95% faster tool lookup
   - 95% reduction in context usage
   - Production-validated in Week 11

5. **Sequential Thinking Integration** (Week 7-8):
   - Added to 3 high-complexity roles
   - Validated through actual use (Week 11 Activity 5)
   - 15x cost justified by better decisions

---

### Challenges Overcome

1. **dbt-MCP Environment Configuration**:
   - Challenge: Semantic layer empty, token limits, permission issues
   - Solution: Documented environment prerequisites
   - Learning: Test MCP tools in production environment early

2. **Custom MCP Development Decision**:
   - Challenge: Build custom MCPs (4-6 weeks) or use existing tools?
   - Solution: Evaluated ROI, deferred development
   - Learning: Validate necessity before major investment

3. **Specialist Count Goal** (15 vs 17+):
   - Challenge: Original goal 17+ specialists
   - Solution: Declared 15 sufficient (all critical domains covered)
   - Learning: Quality over quantity - diminishing returns beyond core domains

4. **Token Budget vs Comprehensive Docs**:
   - Challenge: 200+ pages of research vs context limits
   - Solution: Quick reference cards (fast lookup, low token cost)
   - Learning: Multiple documentation formats for different access patterns

---

### Unexpected Discoveries

1. **aws-docs Currency** (Week 7):
   - Provides CURRENT documentation (post-Jan 2025 training)
   - Service limits, new features, security updates all current
   - Critical for preventing incidents from outdated knowledge

2. **Sequential Thinking Self-Validation** (Week 11):
   - Used to make Week 11 scope decision
   - Demonstrated value through actual application
   - 8-thought analysis prevented wasted validation effort

3. **Environment-Dependent MCP Availability** (Week 11):
   - Not all MCP tools work in all environments
   - Semantic models, token limits, permissions vary
   - Quick references need environment prerequisite sections

4. **Prefect Bash CLI Sufficiency** (Week 9-10):
   - `prefect` CLI provides real-time data access
   - Custom MCP would only add 5-10 confidence points
   - Existing tools highly functional (0.75-0.90 confidence)

---
