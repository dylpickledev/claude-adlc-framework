## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
**Custom MCP Development Delays** (Orchestra, Prefect - Week 3-4)
- **Impact**: Blocks orchestra-expert and prefect-expert revival
- **Mitigation**: Start development Week 2 (parallel), use bash/REST API fallback
- **Contingency**: Defer Orchestra/Prefect specialists to Week 5-6 if needed

**Team Adoption Resistance**
- **Impact**: Team continues direct MCP usage (incorrect pattern)
- **Mitigation**: Clear documentation, training, success metrics
- **Contingency**: Phased rollout, parallel run (old + new patterns)

### Medium Risk
**MCP Server Integration Failures**
- **Impact**: Specialists can't access tools
- **Mitigation**: Phased rollout (1-2 servers per day), comprehensive testing
- **Contingency**: Rollback (disable MCP server, use existing approaches)

**Token Cost Concerns**
- **Impact**: Hesitation to use specialists (15x token cost)
- **Mitigation**: Track error cost savings, quantify ROI (100x-1000x return)
- **Contingency**: Document quality improvements, time-to-resolution gains

**Performance Degradation**
- **Impact**: More tool calls = slower response
- **Mitigation**: Monitor latency, optimize parallel calls
- **Contingency**: Reduce specialist delegation frequency if >60s average

### Dependencies
**External**:
- Anthropic MCP protocol updates (unlikely to break compatibility)
- Official MCP server availability (GitHub, Slack, Atlassian maintained by Anthropic)
- AWS/Snowflake/dbt API stability (production dependencies)

**Internal**:
- Python 3.10+ environment (already satisfied)
- Slack workspace permissions (bot installation)
- GitHub organization access (PAT scopes)
- Orchestra/Prefect API credentials (for custom MCPs)
