# Working Context: sales-journal-to-react

**Last Updated:** 2025-09-30 (Current Session)
**Current Focus:** Corrected to use proper Streamlit source - Analysis and fixes based on working_mostly_9_25.py

## üèñÔ∏è Sandbox Principle: All Work Stays in Project Folder

**CRITICAL RULE**: This project folder is an **isolated sandbox**. All development work stays here until explicit deployment.

## File Sources & Working Versions

### Primary Working Files (Active Development) üìÅ PROJECT SANDBOX
All files below are in the project sandbox and should be modified freely:

- **‚úÖ Streamlit Source (Authoritative)**: `üìÅ working/working_mostly_9_25.py`
  - Lines: 4775
  - Status: THIS IS THE AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE for migration
  - Use for: All feature extraction, migration planning, and reference
  - Contains: 10 tabs, complete Orchestra integration, all business logic
  - Location: `projects/active/feature-salesjournaltoreact/working/working_mostly_9_25.py`

- **üìã Reference Documentation**: `üìÅ STREAMLIT_REFERENCE.md`
  - Complete analysis of working_mostly_9_25.py
  - All 50+ functions, 25+ session state variables documented
  - All database queries with exact table/column names
  - Use this as authoritative reference for migration decisions

- **üîß React Development Code**: Lives in separate repo (see React App Development Target below)
  - All React changes stay in that repo's sandbox until deployment
  - Coordinate changes through this project's documentation

### Reference Files (Read-Only) üì¶ REPO
These files are for comparison only - NEVER write to these during development:

- **‚ùå Outdated Streamlit (DO NOT USE)**: `üì¶ repos/front_end/streamlit_apps_snowflake/Apex Sales Journal/streamlit_app.py`
  - Lines: 2377
  - Status: Outdated version - missing features and functionality
  - Use for: Historical reference ONLY
  - IMPORTANT: All previous analysis using this file should be reviewed

### Deployment Targets üéØ DEPLOY
Where code will ultimately be deployed (ONLY on explicit deployment request):

- **React Production Repo**: TBD (to be determined)
  - Deployment: After migration completion and testing
  - Requires: Explicit "deploy to production" command
  - Testing: Required before any deployment

## Repository Status

### da-agent-hub
- **Branch:** feature-salesjournaltoreact
- **Status:** Active work branch
- **Changes:** Project initialization

### dbt_cloud
- **Branch:** (none yet)
- **Status:** (not started)
- **Changes:** (none)

### Other Repositories
- **streamlit_apps_snowflake**: Reference only (original Streamlit app)

## Active Pull Requests

<!-- Update as PRs are created -->
- No PRs created yet

## Current Blockers

<!-- Track impediments and resolution plans -->
- No blockers identified

## Environment State

### Test Results
- No tests run yet

### Deployment Status  
- No deployments yet

## React App Development Target (Separate Sandbox)

### üèñÔ∏è React Sales Journal App Location
This is a **separate sandbox** - all React work stays here until deployment:

- **üìÅ Development Repository**: `/Users/TehFiestyGoat/da-agent-hub/react-sales-journal/`
- **Status**: Active development - live servers running
- **API Backend**: FastAPI at http://localhost:8000
- **Frontend**: React + Vite at http://localhost:5175
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **UI Framework**: styled-components + framer-motion

**Sandbox Rules for React Repo:**
- All code changes stay in this development repo
- Never push to production repos without explicit request
- Coordinate with this project's documentation for migration decisions
- Use `üìÅ working/working_mostly_9_25.py` as source of truth for features
- **QA Testing Required**: Before reporting changes complete, invoke qa-coordinator for comprehensive testing

## Current Session Work Summary

### ‚úÖ Completed This Session
1. **Fixed mock data fallbacks** - All removed per user requirement
2. **Fixed DMS status logic** - Now checks ALL rows (returns 'CHANGE PROCESSING' only if all match)
3. **Fixed Orchestra API URL** - Changed from api.orchestra.io to app.getorchestra.io
4. **Added getCurrentPipelineStatus()** - New API endpoint for pipeline status card
5. **Updated Quick Actions** - View Journal, Out of Balance, Tieout Management, Documentation
6. **Corrected Streamlit source file** - NOW using working_mostly_9_25.py (4775 lines)
7. **Created STREAMLIT_REFERENCE.md** - Complete analysis of correct source

### üîß Database Query Fixes
- Fixed balance_status query columns (error, batch_type, batch_id instead of out_of_balance_count)
- Fixed dms_status query columns (replication_task, task_status instead of table_name, full_load_rows)

### üìù Key Technical Findings
- Orchestra pipeline history DOES filter by specific IDs: [REFRESH_PIPELINE_ID, FINAL_PIPELINE_ID]
- Pipeline Status card checks `st.session_state.pipeline_status` for RUNNING/CREATED/QUEUED/SUCCEEDED/FAILED/IDLE
- Recent Pipeline Activity shows last 3 of 5 filtered runs
- DMS status must check ALL rows, not just first row
- Filter auto-reset: When batch_type or is_proof changes, batch_id resets to max for new filters

## Agent Findings Summary

- **STREAMLIT_REFERENCE.md:** Complete analysis of working_mostly_9_25.py
  - All 50+ functions documented
  - All 25+ session state variables catalogued
  - All database queries with exact table/column names
  - All Orchestra API integration patterns
  - Complete tab breakdown (10 tabs)

- **MIGRATION_STRATEGY.md:** Comprehensive phased migration plan
  - Current state analysis (~30% complete)
  - 4-phase implementation roadmap
  - Technical architecture patterns
  - Testing strategy and success metrics

## Next Actions

1. **‚úÖ Review all previous changes** against STREAMLIT_REFERENCE.md to ensure alignment
2. **Verify Pipeline Activity filtering** - Ensure React app filters by REFRESH and FINAL pipeline IDs
3. **Implement filter auto-reset** - When batch_type/is_proof changes, reset batch_id to max
4. **Add shared filter state** - Ensure filters persist across tabs
5. **Implement caching with TTL** - Match Streamlit's 300-600 second cache patterns
6. **Add retry logic** - Implement 3-retry pattern with exponential backoff
7. **Test all fixes** - Verify dashboard shows real data, no mock fallbacks
