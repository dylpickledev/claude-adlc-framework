### Architecture Overview
```
apps.grc-ops.com (Single domain for all apps)

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations
1. **No failover/redundancy**: Single task per service (not HA)
   - Acceptable for initial deployment
   - Can increase `desiredCount` later for high availability
2. **No auto-scaling**: Fixed task count
   - Can add auto-scaling policies based on CPU/memory
3. **No multi-region**: Single region (us-west-2) deployment
   - Not needed based on user requirements
4. **Basic monitoring**: CloudWatch metrics only
   - Can add advanced monitoring (X-Ray, CloudWatch Insights) later

### Future Enhancements (Post-Deployment)
1. **Add Apps 2-6**: Follow same pattern (Dockerfile, ECR, ECS service, ALB rule)
2. **Auto-scaling**: Configure ECS service auto-scaling based on metrics
3. **High Availability**: Increase `desiredCount` to 2+ tasks per service
4. **Advanced Monitoring**:
   - AWS X-Ray for distributed tracing
   - CloudWatch Insights for log analysis
   - Custom dashboards for business metrics
5. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automate builds and deployments via GitHub Actions
6. **Backup/DR**: Implement disaster recovery procedures

## Deployment Risks & Mitigations

### High Risk (Likelihood: Medium, Impact: High)
1. **IAM Identity Center OIDC misconfiguration**
   - **Risk**: Users can't authenticate
   - **Mitigation**: Test OIDC flow in non-prod first, follow DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md exactly
   - **Rollback**: Keep Amplify deployment running until verified

2. **ALB listener rule conflicts**
   - **Risk**: Existing services broken by new rules
   - **Mitigation**: Use priority-based rules, test in isolation first
   - **Rollback**: Delete new listener rules

### Medium Risk (Likelihood: Low, Impact: Medium)
3. **Docker build failures**
   - **Risk**: Images don't build correctly
   - **Mitigation**: Test builds locally before ECR push
   - **Rollback**: Use previous Amplify deployment

4. **Health check failures**
   - **Risk**: Target groups mark tasks unhealthy
   - **Mitigation**: Test `/health` endpoints locally
   - **Rollback**: Adjust health check settings

### Low Risk (Likelihood: Low, Impact: Low)
5. **DNS propagation delays**
   - **Risk**: apps.grc-ops.com not resolving immediately
   - **Mitigation**: Allow 5-10 minutes for propagation
   - **Rollback**: N/A (DNS eventually consistent)

## Rollback Plan

### If Deployment Fails (Critical Issues)
1. **Delete ALB listener rules** for `/sales-journal` path
2. **Delete Route 53 record** for apps.grc-ops.com
3. **Stop ECS services** (app-launcher, sales-journal)
4. **Keep Amplify deployment** running as primary
5. **Investigate issue** in DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md troubleshooting section
6. **Re-attempt deployment** after fix

### If Deployment Succeeds but Issues Found
1. **Monitor CloudWatch** for errors/performance issues
2. **Keep Amplify running** as backup for 1 week
3. **Collect user feedback** via Finance team
4. **Make adjustments** to ECS services/ALB rules as needed
5. **Decommission Amplify** after 1 week of stable operation
