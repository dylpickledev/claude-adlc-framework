# Project Specification: Cross-Platform AI Development Workflow

**GitHub Issue:** [#1 - Cross-Platform AI Development Workflow: Making DA Agent Hub Portable](https://github.com/dylpickledev/da-agent-hub/issues/1)

## End Goal

Create a portable architecture that allows any AI coding tool (Cursor, Kiro, Windsurf, Aider, etc.) to implement the DA Agent Hub's proven ADLC workflow, enabling teams to achieve zero-to-AI-intern capabilities regardless of their chosen development environment.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] **Clear Separation:** Workflow logic decoupled from Claude Code-specific implementation
- [ ] **Reference Implementations:** At least 2 working examples beyond Claude Code (e.g., Cursor + Windsurf)
- [ ] **Comprehensive Documentation:** Step-by-step guide enabling teams to adapt workflow to any tool
- [ ] **Core Value Preserved:** Full capture → research → start → complete lifecycle maintained
- [ ] **Agent Portability:** Specialist agent definitions work across different AI tools
- [ ] **Project Structure Consistency:** Same ADLC phases and file organization regardless of tool

## Scope

### Included
- **Dependency Analysis:** Identify Claude Code-specific components (slash commands, Task system, agent invocation patterns)
- **Abstraction Design:** Create tool-agnostic workflow interfaces and patterns
- **Portable Component Identification:** Scripts, project structure, agent definitions, memory system
- **Reference Implementations:** Working examples for Cursor and Windsurf
- **Adaptation Patterns:** Documentation and templates for implementing in new tools
- **Migration Guide:** How existing Claude Code users can transition or multi-tool

### Excluded
- **Full Feature Parity:** Not all Claude Code features required (focus on core ADLC workflow)
- **Tool-Specific Optimization:** Initial version focuses on portability, not performance tuning
- **MCP Integration:** MCP server compatibility analysis deferred to future phase
- **VS Code Extension Development:** Focus on existing tool capabilities, not custom extensions

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Analysis & Dependency Mapping
- [ ] Analyze current Claude Code dependencies
  - Slash command system (`/capture`, `/research`, `/start`, `/complete`)
  - Task tool and subagent invocation patterns
  - Agent coordination mechanisms (role-based, specialists)
  - Memory system (recent/, patterns/, templates/)
- [ ] Identify portable vs. tool-specific components
  - Bash scripts (highly portable)
  - Project structure (portable)
  - Agent definition format (requires adaptation)
  - GitHub integration (portable via gh CLI)
- [ ] Document tool capability requirements
  - Custom command/macro support
  - Multi-file context management
  - Agent/persona switching mechanisms
  - Shell script execution

### Phase 2: Abstraction Design
- [ ] Design tool-agnostic workflow interfaces
  - Command interface abstraction (slash commands → tool macros/commands)
  - Agent invocation abstraction (Task tool → tool-specific mechanisms)
  - Context management patterns (project files → tool workspaces)
- [ ] Create portable agent definition format
  - Markdown-based agent definitions (already portable)
  - Tool-specific activation mechanisms
  - Agent coordination patterns without Task tool
- [ ] Design project structure adaptations
  - Core files (spec.md, context.md, README.md) - already portable
  - Tool-specific enhancements (workspace files, config)
  - Git workflow integration patterns

### Phase 3: Reference Implementations

#### Cursor Implementation
- [ ] Map DA Agent Hub commands to Cursor features
  - Slash commands → Cursor custom commands (.cursorrules)
  - Agent invocation → Cursor Composer with custom prompts
  - Memory system → Cursor's .cursor directory patterns
- [ ] Create Cursor-specific setup guide
- [ ] Test full ADLC workflow in Cursor environment
- [ ] Document limitations and workarounds

#### Windsurf Implementation
- [ ] Map DA Agent Hub commands to Windsurf features
  - Slash commands → Windsurf macros/workflows
  - Agent invocation → Cascade flows with agent personas
  - Memory system → Windsurf knowledge base integration
- [ ] Create Windsurf-specific setup guide
- [ ] Test full ADLC workflow in Windsurf environment
- [ ] Document limitations and workarounds

### Phase 4: Documentation & Adaptation Guide
- [ ] Create cross-platform architecture documentation
  - Core abstractions and interfaces
  - Tool-agnostic workflow patterns
  - Portability guidelines
- [ ] Write adaptation guide for new tools
  - Tool capability assessment checklist
  - Implementation template
  - Common patterns and anti-patterns
- [ ] Create migration guide for Claude Code users
  - Multi-tool workflow strategies
  - Transitioning between tools
  - Maintaining consistency across tools

## Technical Requirements

### Core Portable Components
- **Bash Scripts:** `capture.sh`, `research.sh`, `start.sh`, `finish.sh`, `switch.sh`
- **Project Structure:** `projects/active/`, spec.md, context.md, README.md, tasks/
- **Agent Definitions:** `.claude/agents/` (markdown-based, tool-adaptable)
- **Memory System:** `.claude/memory/` patterns, templates, recent findings
- **GitHub Integration:** `gh` CLI for issues, labels, comments

### Tool-Specific Adapters Needed
- **Command Execution:** How each tool triggers shell scripts
- **Agent Switching:** How each tool loads different agent personas
- **Context Injection:** How each tool reads project files (spec.md, etc.)
- **Multi-File Awareness:** How each tool maintains context across project structure

### Tools & Technologies Analysis

**Target AI Coding Tools:**
1. **Claude Code** (baseline implementation)
   - Slash commands via `.claude/commands/`
   - Task tool for subagent invocation
   - Native project awareness

2. **Cursor** (primary target)
   - `.cursorrules` for custom commands
   - Composer for multi-file editing
   - Custom prompts for agent personas

3. **Windsurf** (primary target)
   - Cascade for workflow automation
   - Flows for command sequences
   - Knowledge base for memory patterns

4. **Aider** (future consideration)
   - CLI-native tool (strong script compatibility)
   - Agent mode for different roles
   - Git-centric workflow (natural fit)

5. **Continue** (future consideration)
   - VS Code extension (workspace integration)
   - Custom commands via config
   - Slash command support

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Core ADLC workflow works in at least 3 different tools
- [ ] Agent coordination possible without Claude Code's Task tool
- [ ] Project structure and files recognized by all target tools
- [ ] GitHub integration (issues, labels) works consistently
- [ ] Memory system accessible across different tools

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] **Maintainability:** Single source of truth for agent definitions
- [ ] **Consistency:** Same project structure produces same outcomes regardless of tool
- [ ] **Discoverability:** Clear documentation for teams evaluating tools
- [ ] **Extensibility:** Patterns enable adding new tools without redesign

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Tool Capability Gaps:** Some tools may lack necessary features (custom commands, multi-file context)
  - *Mitigation:* Identify minimum viable feature set, document limitations clearly
- **Agent Coordination Complexity:** Without Task tool, agent invocation may be manual
  - *Mitigation:* Design simpler agent switching patterns, leverage tool-native features

### Medium Risk
- **Maintenance Burden:** Multiple tool implementations may drift over time
  - *Mitigation:* Core logic in bash scripts (tool-agnostic), minimal tool-specific code
- **User Experience Variation:** Different tools may have different UX for same workflow
  - *Mitigation:* Document expected variations, focus on outcome consistency

### Dependencies
- **Tool Feature Stability:** Cursor, Windsurf may change features/APIs
  - *Mitigation:* Document version requirements, focus on stable features
- **GitHub CLI:** All implementations rely on `gh` CLI availability
  - *Mitigation:* Clear prerequisites in setup guides
- **Bash Environment:** Unix-based systems assumed (macOS, Linux)
  - *Mitigation:* Windows/WSL considerations documented separately

## Timeline Estimate

## Research Questions

1. **Agent Invocation:** How can we replicate Claude Code's Task tool pattern in other tools?
2. **Memory System:** How do different tools handle persistent context (`.claude/memory/` equivalent)?
3. **Command Systems:** What's the most portable way to implement `/capture`, `/start`, etc. across tools?
4. **Multi-Agent Coordination:** Without subagent spawning, how do we coordinate specialist expertise?
5. **Context Management:** How do different tools handle reading/updating multiple project files?

## Success Metrics

- **Portability Score:** % of workflow features working in each target tool
- **Setup Time:** Hours to configure a new tool with DA Agent Hub workflow
- **Consistency Score:** % of project outcomes matching across different tools
- **Adoption Readiness:** Can we confidently recommend 2+ tools for team adoption?
