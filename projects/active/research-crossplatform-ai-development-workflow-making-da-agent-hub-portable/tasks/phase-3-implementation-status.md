## Cursor Implementation Highlights

### Strengths Leveraged

**Composer Multi-File Editing**:
```
@spec.md @src/models/customer_churn.sql @tests/test_customer_churn.py

"Implement customer churn model with tests based on spec"
```
- Simultaneous multi-file editing
- Better than Claude Code for coordinated changes
- Natural fit for file-based coordination

**@ Mentions for Context**:
```
@.claude/agents/specialists/dbt-expert.md
@.claude/memory/patterns/dbt-incremental-optimization-pattern.md

"Apply this pattern to optimize my model"
```
- Seamless agent invocation
- Memory pattern application
- Project file loading

**Familiar VS Code Interface**:
- Lower learning curve for VS Code users
- Extensive extension ecosystem
- Native git integration

### Adaptations Made

**Task Tool → File-Based Coordination**:
- **Claude Code**: `Task(subagent_type="dbt-expert", ...)`
- **Cursor**: `@.claude/agents/specialists/dbt-expert.md` + task files
- **Result**: More manual but explicit and trackable

**TodoWrite → context.md + Cursor Tasks**:
- **Claude Code**: Built-in TodoWrite tool
- **Cursor**: Update context.md with progress, use Cursor's native task system
- **Result**: Simpler, leverages existing features

**Pause → context.md + Chat History**:
- **Claude Code**: Native conversation state saving
- **Cursor**: Document in context.md, reference chat history
- **Result**: Manual but reliable

### What Works Exceptionally Well

1. **File-Based Agent Coordination**: Composer makes multi-file work seamless
2. **Project Structure Loading**: @ mentions for instant context
3. **Memory Pattern Application**: Direct access to proven solutions
4. **Git Workflow**: Native integration better than script-based

### Known Limitations

1. **No Automatic Subagent Spawning**: User must manually invoke specialists
2. **No MCP Tool Support** (yet): Specialists provide expertise without API access
3. **Manual Task Tracking**: No built-in TodoWrite equivalent
4. **Pause Less Automated**: Requires explicit context.md updates

**Mitigation**: All limitations documented in setup guide with workarounds

   - Example: `.cursorrules`, `.windsurf/flows/`, shell aliases

3. **Implement Agent Coordination**:
   - Based on chosen pattern
   - Document in setup guide

4. **Write Setup Guide**:
   - Prerequisites
   - Installation
   - Configuration
   - Usage examples
   - Tool-specific features
   - Troubleshooting

5. **Validate**:
   - Test all commands
   - Verify agent coordination
   - Measure portability score

### Example: Implementing for Aider

**Coordination Pattern**: Manual + Inline Expertise

**Command Adapter**:
```bash
# ~/bin/aider-da-hub/aider-start
./scripts/start.sh "$1"
PROJECT_DIR=$(ls -td projects/active/* | head -1)
echo "aider --read $PROJECT_DIR/spec.md --read .claude/agents/roles/analytics-engineer-role.md"
```

**Shell Aliases**:
```bash
alias da-start='~/bin/aider-da-hub/aider-start'
alias da-complete='./scripts/finish.sh'
```

**Documentation**: Create `AIDER-SETUP-GUIDE.md`

## Key Learnings & Insights

### What Worked Exceptionally Well

1. **80/20 Architecture**: Only .cursorrules needed (20%), everything else portable (80%)
2. **File-Based Coordination**: Natural fit for tools with good multi-file support
3. **Bash Scripts as Core**: Completely tool-agnostic, robust, simple
4. **Markdown Everywhere**: Universal format, no special parsing needed
5. **Non-Linear Workflow**: Flexibility crucial for real-world usage

### Design Validation

**Phase 2 Predictions** ✅ **Confirmed**:
- Thin adapter layer sufficient (600-line .cursorrules)
- File-based coordination viable (works great in Cursor)
- Agent definitions portable (no changes needed)
- Memory system 100% portable (just markdown files)

**Unexpected Benefits**:
- Cursor's Composer superior for multi-file coordination
- @ mentions more intuitive than Task tool for some users
- context.md updates create better documentation trail

### Recommendations for Future Implementations

1. **Start with Coordination Pattern**: Choose before writing adapter
2. **Leverage Tool Strengths**: Don't fight the tool's native UX
3. **Keep Core Portable**: Never put logic in adapters
4. **Document Trade-offs**: Be honest about limitations
5. **Provide Fallbacks**: Manual patterns when automation unavailable
