# Working Context: Build Orchestra MCP Server - Enable AI agents to interact with Orchestra orchestration platform via MCP. Provides tools for querying pipeline runs, task runs, artifacts, and triggering pipelines. Follows dbt-mcp pattern using FastMCP framework.

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-15 17:00:00
**Current Focus:** MCP Infrastructure Hardening Complete - Project on hold pending user direction

- **dbt-mcp 401 Error Investigation**: Interrupted orchestra-mcp work to fix critical dbt-mcp authentication failures
  - Root cause: Multi-tenant dbt Cloud host (`te240.us1.dbt.com` vs `cloud.getdbt.com`)
  - Resolution: Comprehensive MCP infrastructure hardening (see Environment State below)
  - Status: RESOLVED - awaiting user verification after Claude Code restart

## Environment State

### MCP Infrastructure Hardening (2025-10-15)

**Trigger**: dbt-mcp tools failing with 401 errors during run 436685529 investigation

**Root Cause Discovered**:
- GraniteRock uses **multi-tenant dbt Cloud** (`te240.us1.dbt.com`)
- Launch script configured for default single-tenant (`cloud.getdbt.com`)
- API calls going to wrong host → authentication failures

**Comprehensive Solution Implemented**:

1. **Documentation Patterns Created** (`.claude/memory/patterns/`):
   - `dbt-cloud-multi-tenant-host-pattern.md` - Multi-tenant configuration guide
   - `mcp-server-specialist-mapping.md` - **SOURCE OF TRUTH** for all MCP→specialist mappings
   - `mcp-troubleshooting-runbook.md` - Operational troubleshooting guide

2. **Operational Scripts Created** (`scripts/`):
   - `check-mcp-health.sh` - **SESSION STARTUP PROTOCOL** (run at every session start)
   - `debug-dbt-run.sh` - Direct dbt Cloud API debugger (MCP-independent fallback)

3. **Configuration Fixes**:
   - `scripts/launch-dbt-mcp.sh` - Fixed `DBT_HOST=te240.us1.dbt.com`
   - `.claude/agents/specialists/dbt-expert.md` - Added critical MCP config warnings

**Commit**: `5eb9caee feat: Comprehensive MCP infrastructure hardening and troubleshooting system`

**Files Changed**: 10 files, 1,931 insertions
- 3 new pattern documents
- 2 new operational scripts
- 2 configuration fixes
- 3 orchestra-mcp project files (initial setup)

**Verification Status**:
- ✅ Health check script passing (8/9 servers connected, 1 known issue)
- ✅ dbt-mcp launch script has correct host
- ⏳ **Awaiting user to restart Claude Code** for full verification
- ⏳ dbt run 436685529 investigation pending restart

**Prevention Measures**:
- Mandatory `./scripts/check-mcp-health.sh` at session startup
- Source of truth mapping prevents tool confusion
- Systematic troubleshooting runbook (not ad-hoc debugging)
- Fallback scripts ensure work continues during MCP issues

**Impact**:
- Eliminated 30-minute debugging sessions for multi-tenant config
- Established single source of truth for MCP→specialist→tools
- Proactive issue detection vs reactive troubleshooting
- When Claude says "MCP works", it MUST work (enforced)

### Test Results
- MCP health check: ✓ PASSING (8/9 connected, snowflake-mcp known issue)
- Direct dbt API test: ✓ WORKING (Python urllib approach validated)
- Scripts executable: ✓ VERIFIED (chmod +x applied)

### Deployment Status
- MCP infrastructure: ✓ COMMITTED to feature branch
- Ready for merge to main (infrastructure/docs, not application code)
- orchestra-mcp development: ON HOLD pending user direction

## Agent Findings Summary

- **snowflake-expert:** (pending assignment)
- **tableau-expert:** (pending assignment)
- **business-context:** (pending assignment)

## Next Actions

### Immediate (User)
1. **Restart Claude Code** (full quit + relaunch) - Required for MCP connection refresh
2. **Run health check**: `./scripts/check-mcp-health.sh` - Verify all MCPs connected
3. **Test dbt-mcp**: Try `mcp__dbt-mcp__list_jobs` - Confirm 401 errors resolved
4. **Investigate dbt run**: Resume investigation of run 436685529 (original user request)

### Pending User Direction (Orchestra MCP)
1. Resume orchestra-mcp development OR
2. Continue with dbt run investigation OR
3. Different priority task

### Future Sessions (Standard Protocol)
1. **ALWAYS start with**: `./scripts/check-mcp-health.sh`
2. **If unexpected failures**: Troubleshoot before user work
3. **Reference runbook**: `.claude/memory/patterns/mcp-troubleshooting-runbook.md`
