## Feature 1: Query Retry Logic with User Feedback

### Implementation Files Tested
- `react-sales-journal/src/services/api.ts:59-152` (retry logic)
- `react-sales-journal/src/App.tsx:313-325` (toast notifications)

### Test 1.1: Normal Operation (No Retries)

**Test Scenario**: Verify application loads without triggering retry logic under normal conditions

**Test Steps**:
1. Open http://localhost:5176
2. Navigate to Dashboard tab
3. Monitor browser console for any retry messages
4. Verify data loads successfully
5. Check for absence of toast notifications

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Data loads without errors
- ✅ No retry toast notifications appear
- ✅ Console shows no retry warnings
- ✅ Dashboard displays financial data correctly

**Actual Results**:
- Status: [PENDING - MANUAL TESTING REQUIRED]
- Screenshot: [To be captured]
- Console Output: [To be documented]

**Notes**:

### Test 1.2: Simulated Network Failure (Retry Mechanism)

**Test Scenario**: Simulate network issues to trigger retry logic and verify user feedback

**Test Steps**:
1. Open Browser DevTools (Network tab)
2. Simulate network conditions:
   - Option A: Set throttling to "Offline"
   - Option B: Block specific API endpoints
3. Trigger data refresh (navigate between tabs or force reload)
4. Monitor console for retry messages
5. Watch for toast notifications showing retry progress
6. Verify retry counter increments (1/3, 2/3, 3/3)
7. Confirm final error message if all retries exhausted

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Toast notification appears: "Retrying Request (1/3)"
- ✅ Subsequent retries shown: (2/3), (3/3)
- ✅ Console logs show retry attempts with endpoint details
- ✅ Final error displayed if all retries fail
- ✅ User-friendly error message (not technical stack trace)

**Actual Results**:
- Status: [PENDING - MANUAL TESTING REQUIRED]
- Retry Toast Screenshot: [To be captured]
- Console Output: [To be documented]
- Error Handling: [To be verified]

**Notes**:

### Test 1.3: Retry Recovery (Successful Recovery After Failure)

**Test Scenario**: Verify application recovers successfully when network improves during retry attempts

**Test Steps**:
1. Start with throttled network (Slow 3G or offline)
2. Trigger data load (should initiate retries)
3. After first retry appears, remove throttling (restore online)
4. Observe if data loads successfully
5. Verify no error state persists after recovery
6. Confirm application returns to normal operation

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Retry initiated when network throttled
- ✅ Data loads successfully after network restored
- ✅ No error state remains after recovery
- ✅ Application functions normally post-recovery
- ✅ Console shows successful request after retry

**Actual Results**:
- Status: [PENDING - MANUAL TESTING REQUIRED]
- Recovery Screenshot: [To be captured]
- Console Output: [To be documented]

**Notes**:
[To be filled during testing]

## Feature 2: Shared Filter State Persistence Across Tabs

### Implementation Files Tested
- `react-sales-journal/src/store/financialStore.ts` (single source of truth for filters)

### Test 2.1: Cross-Tab Filter Persistence

**Test Scenario**: Verify filters persist when switching between tabs (Dashboard, Sales Journal, Out of Balance)

**Test Steps**:
1. Navigate to Sales Journal tab
2. Record current filter values:
   - batch_type: [Document value]
   - is_proof: [Document value]
   - batch_id: [Document value]
3. Change batch_type from CASH to CREDIT
4. Switch to Dashboard tab
5. Verify Dashboard shows CREDIT batch data
6. Switch to Out of Balance tab
7. Verify Out of Balance uses CREDIT filters
8. Switch back to Sales Journal tab
9. Verify batch_type still shows CREDIT (not reverted to CASH)

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Filter changes in Sales Journal persist to Dashboard
- ✅ Dashboard data reflects CREDIT batch_type
- ✅ Out of Balance tab shows CREDIT filters
- ✅ Returning to Sales Journal maintains CREDIT selection
- ✅ No filter resets occur during tab switching
- ✅ All three tabs show consistent filter state

**Actual Results**:
- Status: [PENDING - MANUAL TESTING REQUIRED]
- Initial State Screenshot: [To be captured]
- Post-Change Dashboard Screenshot: [To be captured]
- Out of Balance Screenshot: [To be captured]
- Return to Sales Journal Screenshot: [To be captured]

### Test 2.2: Filter Change Propagation Across Tabs

**Test Scenario**: Verify filter changes made in one tab immediately affect other tabs

**Test Steps**:
1. Navigate to Dashboard tab
2. Note current is_proof value
3. Change is_proof from 'Y' to 'N'
4. Expected: Out of Balance card should disappear (requires proof mode)
5. Switch to Sales Journal tab
6. Verify is_proof shows 'N' (not 'Y')
7. Verify Sales Journal data reflects is_proof='N'
8. Switch back to Dashboard
9. Confirm is_proof still shows 'N'

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Changing is_proof to 'N' on Dashboard hides Out of Balance card
- ✅ Sales Journal tab shows is_proof='N' when visited
- ✅ Sales Journal data reflects non-proof mode
- ✅ Filter change persists across all tabs
- ✅ No data inconsistencies between tabs

**Actual Results**:
- Status: [PENDING - MANUAL TESTING REQUIRED]
- Dashboard Before Change: [Screenshot]
- Dashboard After is_proof='N': [Screenshot]
- Sales Journal with is_proof='N': [Screenshot]

## Feature 3: Filter Auto-Reset Logic

### Implementation Files Tested
- `react-sales-journal/src/store/financialStore.ts:454-509` (checkAndResetBatchId)

### Test 3.1: Batch Type Change Triggers Auto-Reset

**Test Scenario**: Verify batch_id automatically resets to max when batch_type changes

**Test Steps**:
1. Navigate to Sales Journal tab
2. Set filters to known state:
   - batch_type: 'CASH'
   - is_proof: 'Y'
   - batch_id: [Record specific value, e.g., '12345']
3. Open browser console to monitor auto-reset logs
4. Change batch_type from 'CASH' to 'CREDIT'
5. Immediately check console for auto-reset messages
6. Verify batch_id value changes (no longer '12345')
7. Confirm new batch_id is max for CREDIT/Y combination

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Changing batch_type triggers immediate batch_id reset
- ✅ batch_id updates to max for new CREDIT/Y combination
- ✅ Console shows: "Filter change detected, resetting batch_id..."
- ✅ Console shows: "Auto-reset batch_id to: [new_value]"
- ✅ Old batch_id (12345) is NOT retained
- ✅ Data refreshes to show CREDIT batches

**Actual Results**:
- Status: [PENDING - MANUAL TESTING REQUIRED]
- Initial State (CASH/Y/12345): [Screenshot]
- Console Logs During Change: [Screenshot]
- Final State (CREDIT/Y/new_id): [Screenshot]
- Console Output:
  ```
  [To be captured from browser console]
  ```

### Test 3.2: Proof Mode Change Triggers Auto-Reset

**Test Scenario**: Verify batch_id resets when is_proof changes

**Test Steps**:
1. Set filters to known state:
   - batch_type: 'CASH'
   - is_proof: 'Y'
   - batch_id: [Record value]
2. Monitor console
3. Change is_proof from 'Y' to 'N'
4. Verify batch_id resets to max for CASH/N combination
5. Confirm console logs show reset
6. Verify data updates to non-proof mode

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ is_proof change triggers batch_id reset
- ✅ batch_id updates to max for CASH/N
- ✅ Console confirms auto-reset
- ✅ Data reflects non-proof mode
- ✅ Old batch_id not retained

**Actual Results**:
- Status: [PENDING - MANUAL TESTING REQUIRED]
- Before Change (CASH/Y): [Screenshot]
- After Change (CASH/N): [Screenshot]
- Console Output: [To be captured]

**Notes**:

### Test 3.3: Auto-Reset Persists Across Tab Switches

**Test Scenario**: Verify auto-reset works even when filter changes happen on different tabs

**Test Steps**:
1. On Sales Journal tab: Set CASH/Y, record batch_id (e.g., '12345')
2. Switch to Dashboard tab
3. On Dashboard (or via sidebar filter): Change batch_type to CREDIT
4. Monitor console for auto-reset messages
5. Verify batch_id resets immediately
6. Switch back to Sales Journal tab
7. Confirm Sales Journal shows:
   - batch_type: CREDIT (not CASH)
   - batch_id: new value (NOT '12345')
   - Data reflects CREDIT batches

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Filter change on Dashboard triggers auto-reset
- ✅ batch_id updates immediately
- ✅ Returning to Sales Journal shows updated state
- ✅ Old batch_id (12345) NOT retained
- ✅ Cross-tab auto-reset works correctly
- ✅ Console shows reset logs

**Actual Results**:
- Status: [PENDING - MANUAL TESTING REQUIRED]
- Sales Journal Initial (CASH/Y/12345): [Screenshot]
- Dashboard After Change to CREDIT: [Screenshot]
- Sales Journal After Return: [Screenshot]
- Console Logs: [To be captured]
