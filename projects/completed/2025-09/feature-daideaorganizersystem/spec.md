# D&A Idea Organizer System Specification

## Project Overview
**Type**: feature
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks
**Scope**: Create an AI-powered "spaghetti organizer" system that helps the D&A team capture raw ideas and transform them into structured, actionable projects.

## End Goal
A simple, Claude-integrated system within da-agent-hub that:
1. **Captures raw ideas** during brainstorming sessions
2. **Organizes and structures** those ideas using AI analysis
3. **Transforms concepts** into actionable project specs
4. **Maintains smart boundaries** with ClickUp for minimal workflow disruption

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Team can dump "spaghetti" ideas quickly without structure constraints
- [ ] Claude can analyze and organize ideas into coherent themes/projects
- [ ] Smooth transition from idea → project spec → work execution
- [ ] Clear decision framework for what stays local vs. goes to ClickUp
- [ ] Quarterly planning support for D&A team strategic sessions

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Ideation Infrastructure (Week 1)
- [ ] Create `/ideate [concept]` command for rapid idea capture
- [ ] Design simple idea storage format (markdown-based)
- [ ] Build AI-powered idea organization and clustering
- [ ] Implement idea → project transition workflow

### Phase 2: Organization & Analysis (Week 2)
- [ ] Create quarterly planning templates and workflows
- [ ] Build priority scoring framework (impact/effort matrices)
- [ ] Add cross-domain analysis using existing specialist agents
- [ ] Implement dependency mapping between ideas/projects

### Phase 3: ClickUp Integration Strategy (Week 3)
- [ ] Define granularity boundaries (local vs. ClickUp)
- [ ] Create export/sync utilities for strategic roadmaps
- [ ] Build workflow for promoting local projects to ClickUp
- [ ] Add collaboration templates for stakeholder sharing

## Technical Requirements

### Core Components
```
ideas/
├── inbox/              # Raw idea capture (unsorted)
├── organized/          # AI-clustered and structured ideas
├── quarterly/          # Quarterly planning sessions
├── pipeline/           # Ideas in transition to projects
└── archive/           # Completed or rejected ideas
```

### Integration Points
- **Existing project system**: Seamless transition via `/start_project`
- **Specialist agents**: Use dbt-expert, snowflake-expert, etc. for technical analysis
- **ClickUp boundaries**: Strategic roadmaps and stakeholder items only
- **Git workflow**: Full version control for idea evolution

### Key Commands
- `/ideate [concept]` - Rapid idea capture with AI structuring
- `/organize` - AI-powered clustering and analysis of current ideas
- `/quarterly` - Facilitate quarterly planning sessions
- `/promote [idea] [clickup|project]` - Move ideas to next stage

## ClickUp Integration Strategy

### Local (da-agent-hub)
- **Technical spikes** and proof-of-concepts
- **Detailed project execution** (models, code, testing)
- **Agent coordination** and technical findings
- **Knowledge preservation** and learning documentation

### ClickUp
- **Strategic initiatives** requiring executive visibility
- **Cross-departmental projects** involving other teams
- **Budget requests** and resource allocation decisions
- **Stakeholder communication** and milestone tracking

### Sync Strategy
- **Export quarterly roadmaps** to ClickUp for stakeholder sharing
- **Promote high-impact projects** to ClickUp when they need cross-team coordination
- **Keep technical execution details** in da-agent-hub
- **Maintain links/references** between systems for full context

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Complexity creep**: Keep system simple, focus on core "organize spaghetti" need
- **Integration friction**: Ensure ClickUp boundaries are clear and useful

### Process Risks
- **Adoption resistance**: Make idea capture faster than current methods
- **System fragmentation**: Clear guidelines on what goes where

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Start minimal**: Focus on idea capture and organization first
- **Iterate based on usage**: Let team feedback drive feature development
- **Clear documentation**: Make boundaries and workflows obvious

## Timeline Estimate
**2-3 weeks** for full implementation across all phases

## Dependencies
- Existing da-agent-hub project management system
- Claude Code CLI and specialist agents
- Team willingness to pilot new ideation workflows
- ClickUp access for integration testing

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Team can brain-dump ideas in under 30 seconds per concept
2. Claude can organize 10+ raw ideas into 2-3 coherent project themes
3. Smooth workflow from idea → structured concept → project spec
4. Clear decision tree for local vs. ClickUp placement
5. Quarterly planning session can be conducted entirely within system
6. Export functionality produces ClickUp-ready strategic summaries
