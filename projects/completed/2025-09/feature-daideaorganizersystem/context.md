## Current Focus
Defining the scope and architecture for a "spaghetti organizer" system that helps the D&A team:
1. Quickly capture raw brainstorming ideas
2. Use AI to structure and organize those ideas
3. Transform concepts into actionable projects
4. Maintain smart boundaries with ClickUp

## Key Decisions Made
- **Complementary to ClickUp**: Not replacing, but handling different granularity
- **Local granularity**: Technical execution, spikes, detailed project work
- **ClickUp granularity**: Strategic initiatives, cross-department, executive visibility
- **Simple approach**: Focus on core "organize spaghetti" need, avoid complexity creep
- **Quarterly planning**: Primary use case for D&A team strategic sessions

## Next Actions
1. Begin Phase 1 implementation (Core Ideation Infrastructure)
2. Create `/ideate` command and basic idea storage system
3. Build AI-powered organization capabilities
4. Test with real D&A team brainstorming scenarios

## Blockers
None currently identified

## Technical Context

## Stakeholders
- **Primary**: D&A team for ideation and quarterly planning
- **Secondary**: Leadership team (via ClickUp exports for strategic roadmaps)
- **Users**: Team members conducting brainstorming and strategic planning sessions
