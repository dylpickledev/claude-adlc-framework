**Created:** 2025-09-22 09:48:57  
**Type:** feature  
**Work Branch:** feature-daideaorganizersystem

## Quick Navigation

- ðŸ“‹ **[Specification](./spec.md)** - Project goals, requirements, and implementation plan
- ðŸ”„ **[Working Context](./context.md)** - Current state, branches, PRs, and blockers
- ðŸ¤– **[Agent Tasks](./tasks/)** - Sub-agent coordination and findings

## Progress Summary

**Current Phase**: Project initialization and specification complete
- âœ… Defined comprehensive project specification with 3-phase implementation plan
- âœ… Established ClickUp integration strategy (complementary, not replacement)
- âœ… Outlined technical architecture using existing da-agent-hub infrastructure
- ðŸ”„ Ready to begin Phase 1: Core Ideation Infrastructure

## Key Decisions Made

**Scope & Approach**
- **"Spaghetti Organizer"**: Focus on helping D&A team brainstorm freely, then AI structures ideas
- **Complementary to ClickUp**: Handle different granularity levels, not replacement
- **Simple approach**: Avoid complexity creep, focus on core organizing need

**System Boundaries**
- **Local (da-agent-hub)**: Technical spikes, detailed execution, agent coordination, knowledge preservation
- **ClickUp**: Strategic initiatives, cross-departmental projects, executive visibility, budget requests
- **Sync strategy**: Export quarterly roadmaps, promote high-impact projects, maintain reference links

**Technical Decisions**
- **Markdown-based storage**: Simple, readable, version-controlled idea management
- **Existing infrastructure**: Build on current project management and agent systems
- **AI-powered organization**: Use Claude and specialist agents for clustering and analysis
