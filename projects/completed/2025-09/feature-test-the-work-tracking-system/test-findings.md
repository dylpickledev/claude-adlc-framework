# Test Findings

## Work Init Script
- ✅ Creates proper directory structure
- ✅ Generates comprehensive README template
- ✅ Creates and switches to work branch
- ✅ Stages initial README

## Project Structure
- Clean folder organization under projects/
- Clear separation of active vs completed work
- Git tracking works correctly
- **Important:** Projects folder for coordination only, repos/ for code

## Coordination vs Code Separation
- `projects/` = Project management, notes, analysis, PR links
- `repos/` = All actual code changes across multiple repositories
- Clean separation prevents confusion about where files belong

## Sample Cross-Repo Project Structure
```
projects/feature-optimize-dbt-performance/
├── README.md                      # Links to PRs in multiple repos
├── analysis/slow-queries.md       # Performance analysis
└── notes/stakeholder-feedback.md  # Business context

repos/dbt_cloud/
├── models/marts/faster_model.sql   # Optimized dbt models
└── macros/performance_utils.sql    # New performance macros

repos/snowflake_utils/
└── monitoring/query_tracker.py     # Performance monitoring
```

## Next Steps for Real Projects
- Test cross-repository PR linking in README
- Validate knowledge dissemination from coordination files
- Ensure clear handoff between project coordination and repo work
