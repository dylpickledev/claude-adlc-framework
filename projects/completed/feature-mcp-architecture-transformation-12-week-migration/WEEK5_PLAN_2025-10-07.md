# Week 5 Plan: New Specialist Creation & Pattern Documentation

**Start Date**: 2025-10-07
**Phase**: Week 5 - New Specialists + Knowledge Capture
**Status**: 🟡 Planning

## Executive Summary

Week 5 pivots from the original spec (tableau/dlthub revival - already done) to focus on **high-value specialist creation** and **pattern documentation** based on Weeks 2-4 learnings.

**Why the pivot?**: Weeks 3-4 testing proved tableau-expert and dlthub-expert are already excellent. Instead of "reviving" specialists that work perfectly, we're accelerating the timeline by creating NEW specialists that would have massive business impact.

## Revised Week 5 Objectives

### Primary Objectives (High Value)

**1. Create cost-optimization-specialist** (NEW)
- **Rationale**: Week 3-4 testing identified $575K+ in savings across 4 tests
- **Expertise**: Cross-system cost analysis (Snowflake, AWS, Tableau, dbt)
- **Delegation from**: All role agents (cost is universal concern)
- **MCP Tools**: snowflake-mcp, aws-api, dbt-mcp, tableau-mcp (when available)
- **Estimated Impact**: Systematic cost optimization could find millions in savings
- **Timeline**: 1-2 days to create and test

**2. Create data-quality-specialist** (NEW)
- **Rationale**: Deterministic MERGE bug caught in Test 2 - quality specialists prevent production issues
- **Expertise**: Data validation, testing strategies, contract enforcement
- **Delegation from**: analytics-engineer, data-engineer, dba roles
- **MCP Tools**: dbt-mcp (test strategies), snowflake-mcp (validation queries), sequential-thinking-mcp
- **Estimated Impact**: Reduce production data quality incidents by 50%+
- **Timeline**: 1-2 days to create and test

**3. Document Delegation Best Practices** (Continuous Improvement)
- Capture Week 3-4 learnings into reusable patterns
- Update specialist templates with proven approaches
- Create cross-specialist coordination template
- Document cost-benefit analysis standard
- **Timeline**: 1 day

### Secondary Objectives (Nice to Have)

**4. memory-mcp Integration Scoping** (Deferred from Week 2)
- Research Anthropic's memory-mcp best practices
- Design integration approach for DA Agent Hub
- Plan implementation (likely Week 6+)
- **Timeline**: 0.5 days research

**5. Tier 2 Specialist Updates** (On-demand)
- Update prefect-expert, react-expert, streamlit-expert ONLY if needed for active work
- Otherwise defer to Week 7 (development specialists week)
- **Timeline**: Variable (0-2 days depending on need)

## Objectives Comparison: Original vs Revised

| Original Week 5 | Status | Revised Week 5 | Rationale |
|-----------------|--------|----------------|-----------|
| Revival: tableau-expert | ✅ Already done | Create: cost-optimization-specialist | Tableau already excellent (Test 3) |
| Revival: dlthub-expert | ✅ Already done | Create: data-quality-specialist | dlthub already production-ready |
| memory-mcp integration | ⏸️ Not critical | Document delegation best practices | Capture Week 3-4 learnings |
| Advanced capabilities testing | ✅ Already done | memory-mcp scoping (research only) | Testing complete (4 successful tests) |

**Net Effect**: Week 5 stays on timeline but delivers MORE value by creating high-impact specialists instead of fixing things that already work.

### Week 6 Planning (Preliminary)

Based on Week 5 outcomes, Week 6 could focus on:

**Option A**: Continue specialist creation (if cost/quality specialists are successful)
- Create performance-optimization-specialist
- Create security-compliance-specialist
- Build out specialist ecosystem

**Option B**: Focus on production deployment (apply Week 3-4 findings)
- Implement tableau optimization ($384K savings from Test 3)
- Implement dbt incremental conversion (Test 2 recommendations)
- Measure actual vs predicted outcomes

**Option C**: Custom MCP development (if Week 5 research shows high value)
- Build orchestra-mcp (deferred from Week 3-4)
- Build prefect-mcp (deferred from Week 3-4)
- Enhance specialist intelligence with real-time data

**Recommendation**: **Option B** (Production deployment) - Deliver immediate business value while continuing specialist creation in parallel.

## Appendix: Week 5 vs Original Plan

### What Changed and Why

**Original**: Revival of tableau-expert and dlthub-expert
**Reality**: Both already excellent (validated in Week 3 testing)
**Decision**: Accelerate to Week 6 objectives (new specialist creation)

**Original**: memory-mcp integration implementation
**Reality**: Not critical path, specialist pattern works without it
**Decision**: Research only, defer implementation decision to Week 6

**Original**: Advanced capabilities testing
**Reality**: Already completed in Week 3-4 (4 successful tests)
**Decision**: Focus on documenting learnings instead of more testing

### Net Timeline Impact

**Original Week 5**: 5-7 days
**Revised Week 5**: 3 days
**Time Saved**: 2-4 days

**Use of saved time**: Apply to Week 6 production deployment or custom MCP development

---

**Week 5 Status**: PLANNED ✅
**Ready to Execute**: YES
**High-Value Focus**: cost-optimization and data-quality specialists
**Timeline**: 3 days (ahead of original 5-7 day estimate)
