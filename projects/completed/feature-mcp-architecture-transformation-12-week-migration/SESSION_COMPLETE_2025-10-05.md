## Key Architecture Decisions

### 1. Role → Specialist (with MCP) Pattern ✅

**Research-validated by Anthropic**:
- Multi-agent: 15x tokens but significantly better outcomes
- MCP provides DATA, specialists provide EXPERTISE
- Together = Informed, validated, correct recommendations

**Implemented**:
- Roles delegate when confidence <0.60 OR expertise beneficial
- Specialists use MCP tools + domain expertise
- Return expert-validated recommendations
- Correctness > Speed priority

### 2. cloud-manager-role Deprecated ✅

**Rationale**:
- Was attempting direct MCP usage without specialist pattern
- Merged capabilities into aws-expert infrastructure specialist
- Simpler: Single AWS specialist vs role + specialist split

**Result**:
- aws-expert is THE AWS infrastructure specialist
- All roles delegate AWS work to aws-expert
- aws-expert uses aws-api, aws-docs, aws-knowledge + expertise

### 3. Folder Organization (roles/, specialists/, deprecated/) ✅

**Rationale**:
- Visual reinforcement of three-layer architecture
- Scalability as agent count grows (10 roles + specialists)
- Matches conceptual design
- Community pattern validation

**Benefits**:
- Easy navigation by agent type
- Clear separation: primary vs consultation vs historical
- Template location strategy (templates next to agents)

### 4. Specialist Revival Priority ✅

**Week 1** (COMPLETE):
- aws-expert (enhanced)
- dbt-expert (revived)
- snowflake-expert (revived)

**Week 3-4** (CRITICAL - Custom MCP needed):
- orchestra-expert (needs orchestra-mcp custom development)
- prefect-expert (needs prefect-mcp custom development)

**Week 5-6**:
- tableau-expert
- dlthub-expert

**Week 7+**:
- github-sleuth-expert
- react-expert
- streamlit-expert
- Others as needed

See `docs/mcp-research-2025/architecture-migration-plan.md`

## Research Findings Summary

### The Core Question

**User asked**: "Are AWS specialists needed when we have AWS MCP servers?"

**Research answer**: **Absolutely YES**

**Why**:
- MCP = Data access ("You have 3 ECS services")
- Specialist = Expertise ("Deploy to sales-journal service with blue/green strategy")
- MCP alone = Guessing with domain data
- MCP + Specialist = Informed, validated decisions

### The Pattern

**✅ CORRECT**: Role → Specialist (specialist uses MCP + expertise)
**❌ INCORRECT**: Role → MCP tools directly (data without expertise)

### The Trade-off

**Token Cost**: 15x more for specialist pattern
**Error Prevention**: 100x-1000x ROI
**User Priority**: Correctness > Speed ✅ **ALIGNED**

### The Evidence

**Anthropic research**:
> "For complex tasks with multiple considerations, LLMs generally perform better when each consideration is handled by a separate LLM call"

> Multi-agent systems use 15x more tokens but provide significantly better outcomes

**DA Agent Hub validation**:
- Role-based migration: 50-70% coordination reduction
- Specialist pattern proven effective
- Quality improvements measurable

- business-analyst-role
- dba-role
- qa-engineer-role
- project-manager-role

**Add delegation protocols** to each (use analytics-engineer-role as template)

**Estimated**: 1 week (5-10 hours)

---

## What's Ready to Use (After Restart)

### MCP Tools

**Available now** (9 servers):
- dbt Cloud analysis (dbt-mcp)
- Snowflake queries (snowflake-mcp)
- AWS infrastructure (aws-api, aws-docs, aws-knowledge)
- Version control (git-mcp)
- File operations (filesystem-mcp)
- Complex reasoning (sequential-thinking-mcp)
- Service desk (freshservice-mcp)

**After Day 3** (github token):
- Repository analysis (github-mcp)

**After Day 4-5** (slack tokens):
- Team communication (slack-mcp)

### Specialists

**Active specialists**:
1. **aws-expert**: ALL AWS infrastructure work
   - Uses: aws-api, aws-docs, aws-knowledge
   - Delegates from: ui-ux-developer, data-engineer, analytics-engineer, others

2. **dbt-expert**: ALL dbt transformation work
   - Uses: dbt-mcp, snowflake-mcp, git-mcp, sequential-thinking-mcp
   - Delegates from: analytics-engineer, data-engineer, data-architect, bi-developer, qa-engineer

3. **snowflake-expert**: ALL Snowflake warehouse work
   - Uses: snowflake-mcp, dbt-mcp, git-mcp, sequential-thinking-mcp
   - Delegates from: analytics-engineer, dba, data-engineer, bi-developer, data-architect

### Delegation Pattern

**Example** (Your scenario: "Update AWS React app"):
```
ui-ux-developer-role
    ↓ "I've built React updates, need AWS deployment"
    ↓ Recognizes: Confidence 0.30 on AWS → DELEGATE
    ↓ Prepares context (task, current state, requirements, constraints)
    ↓ DELEGATES to aws-expert

aws-expert
    ├─ Uses aws-api MCP → Gets current ECS/ALB/CloudFront config
    ├─ Uses aws-knowledge MCP → Gets deployment best practices
    ├─ Uses aws-docs MCP → Validates latest ECS syntax
    ├─ Applies AWS expertise → Synthesizes deployment strategy
    │   - Validates health checks
    │   - Ensures ALB OIDC auth preserved
    │   - Optimizes for cost constraint
    │   - Designs zero-downtime approach
    │   - Creates rollback plan
    └─ Returns: Expert-validated deployment plan

ui-ux-developer-role
    └─ Executes deployment plan with confidence ✅
```

**Result**: Correct, production-ready deployment
