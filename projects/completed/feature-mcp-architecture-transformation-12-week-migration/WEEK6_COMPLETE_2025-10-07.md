- Result: High-quality specialists upgraded quickly (1 day total)

**2. Pattern Reuse Across Specialists**
- react-expert and streamlit-expert both reference Test 4 (aws-expert ECS deployment)
- prefect-expert references Test 1 (orchestra-expert comparison patterns)
- Result: Cross-specialist consistency, proven patterns leveraged

**3. Production-Validated Confidence Levels**
- react-expert: 0.90 confidence on ECS deployment (from sales-journal/app-portal)
- All specialists: Confidence levels evidence-based, not guessed
- Result: Higher initial quality, clearer delegation triggers

### Week 6 vs Original Plan

**Original Week 6 Objectives**:
