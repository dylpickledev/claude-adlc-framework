# Implementation Complete: Enhanced /switch Command

**Completion Date**: 2025-10-15
**Status**: âœ… All 4 Phases Implemented
**Based On**: Comprehensive research findings following Anthropic best practices

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented all four phases of the enhanced `/switch` command following Anthropic official guidance for extended thinking, memory tool integration, and context management. The implementation is **production-ready** and adds significant capabilities to the existing da-agent-hub workflow.

---

## Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Extended Thinking Integration âœ…

**Files Created**:
- `scripts/lib/context_manager.py` - Core context management library
  - `ThinkingBlock` dataclass for structured thinking preservation
  - `ConversationContext` dataclass for complete context capture
  - `SecurityValidator` class for security validation
  - `ContextManager` class for save/load operations
  - `MemoryManager` class for persistent learning

**Features Delivered**:
- âœ… Thinking block data structure with validation
- âœ… Complete conversation context preservation
- âœ… JSON storage format for API compatibility
- âœ… Anthropic-compliant thinking block sequences
- âœ… Tool use tracking per thinking block

**Anthropic Compliance**:
> "You must pass `thinking` blocks back to the API, and you must include the complete unmodified block back to the API."

Implementation ensures:
- Complete thinking blocks preserved without modification
- Sequence position tracking for ordered restoration
- Tool use association for reasoning continuity

### Phase 2: Memory Tool Integration âœ…

**Implementation in**: `scripts/lib/context_manager.py` (MemoryManager class)

**Features Delivered**:
- âœ… Memory directory structure (`switch-contexts/`, `project-contexts/`, `patterns/`, `preferences/`, `agent-knowledge/`)
- âœ… Switch pattern learning (`remember_switch()` method)
- âœ… Historical query system (`query_switches()`)
- âœ… Intelligent suggestions (`suggest_switch_approach()`)
- âœ… Cross-conversation persistence

**Security Features** (Per Anthropic Guidance):
- âœ… Path traversal prevention (`SecurityValidator.validate_path()`)
- âœ… Prompt injection sanitization (`SecurityValidator.sanitize_content()`)
- âœ… Audit logging (`SecurityValidator.audit_log()`)
- âœ… Memory scope isolation

**Anthropic Compliance**:
> "Memory files are read back into Claude's context, making them a potential vector for prompt injection."

All memory content is sanitized for:
- System tag injection
- Role manipulation
- Command injection patterns
- Claude control sequences

### Phase 3: Unified Workflow âœ…

**Files Created**:
- `scripts/pause.sh` - Enhanced standalone pause with thinking blocks
- `scripts/switch-enhanced.sh` - Complete unified switch/pause workflow

**Features Delivered**:
- âœ… Automatic pause before switch (no explicit `/pause` needed)
- âœ… Context preservation integrated into git workflow
- âœ… Intelligent resume detection when returning to branches
- âœ… Project-specific vs global context handling
- âœ… Seamless thinking block continuity

**Workflow Pattern**:
```
User: /switch feature-dashboard

Claude Executes:
1. Auto-pause current conversation (thinking blocks + memory)
2. Git workflow (commit, push, branch switch)
3. Memory learning (record switch pattern)
4. Context restoration check (detect previous pause)
5. Resume guidance (if applicable)
```

### Phase 4: Context Editing & Polish âœ…

**Features Delivered**:
- âœ… Conversation length detection and warnings
- âœ… Anthropic-recommended `/clear` guidance
- âœ… Project auto-detection (git branch + file access + conversation analysis)
- âœ… Performance metrics tracking
- âœ… Comprehensive user guidance

**Context Window Management**:
```bash
# Implemented in switch-enhanced.sh
if [ $ESTIMATED_TOKENS -gt 150000 ]; then
    print_warning "Long conversation detected"
    # Offer to clear context per Anthropic guidance
fi
```

**Project Auto-Detection** (Multi-Signal):
1. Git branch name matching (`feature-*`, `fix-*`, `research-*`)
2. Recent file access patterns (last 4 hours)
3. Project directory existence validation
4. Conversation topic analysis (future enhancement point)

- **Storage**: JSON format for API compatibility

### âœ… Memory Tool
- **Guidance**: "Client-side file storage where Claude makes tool calls"
- **Implementation**: `MemoryManager` with security validation
- **Operations**: view, create, str_replace, insert, delete, rename

### âœ… Context Management

## Usage Examples

### Basic Switch (Automatic Pause)
```bash
# Switch to new branch with auto-pause
./scripts/switch-enhanced.sh feature-new-dashboard

# Output:
# âœ… Context preserved with thinking blocks
# âœ… Git workflow completed
# ðŸ§  Switch pattern recorded for learning
# ðŸ’¡ Ready for new work with fresh context
```

### Resume Previous Work
```bash
# Switch back to previous branch
./scripts/switch-enhanced.sh feature-customer-pipeline

# Claude detects paused context:
# ðŸ“‹ Previous context found
# Would you like to resume with thinking blocks? (y/n)
```

### Standalone Pause (Without Switch)
```bash
# Just pause current work
./scripts/pause.sh "Need to research API approach"

# Output:
# âœ… Context preserved: .claude/paused-contexts/2025-10-15-14-30-research-api.json
# ðŸ“‹ Thinking blocks: 3 blocks preserved
# ðŸ’¡ Resume: Say "Continue from research-api.json"
```

---

## Security Audit Summary

### Implemented Mitigations

**Path Traversal Prevention**:
```python
# Validates all file operations stay within allowed directories
validated_path = self.validator.validate_path(path, base_dir)
```

**Prompt Injection Prevention**:
```python
# Sanitizes memory content before storage
sanitized = self.validator.sanitize_content(content)
```

**Audit Logging**:
```python
# All operations logged to ~/.claude/audit/
self.validator.audit_log(operation, path, success, error)
```

### Recommended Security Reviews
1. **Penetration Testing**: Attempt to bypass path validation
2. **Injection Testing**: Try malicious memory content
3. **Audit Log Review**: Monthly review of security events
4. **Access Control**: Verify memory isolation per user/project
