## Priority 1: HIGH IMPACT (Implement This Sprint)

### 1.1 Add Chain-of-Thought Reasoning to Agent Templates

**Current State**: Agents reason implicitly
**Anthropic Best Practice**: "Tell Claude to think step by step"
**Impact**: 20% accuracy improvement (per Anthropic research)
**Effort**: Low (1-2 hours)

#### Implementation

**File to Update**: `.claude/agents/roles/role-template.md` and `.claude/agents/specialists/specialist-template.md`

**Add Section**:
```markdown
## Reasoning Protocol

### Chain-of-Thought Requirement
For ALL analyses and recommendations, use explicit step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Understand**: Restate the problem in your own words
2. **Decompose**: Break down into component parts
3. **Analyze**: Examine each component systematically
4. **Synthesize**: Combine findings into coherent conclusion
5. **Validate**: Check conclusion against requirements

### Format
Use this structure in your reports:

<reasoning>
Step 1 - Understanding:
[Your restatement of the problem]

Step 2 - Decomposition:
[Component breakdown]

Step 3 - Analysis:
[Systematic examination]

Step 4 - Synthesis:
[Combined findings]

Step 5 - Validation:
[Confidence check]
</reasoning>

<recommendation>
[Your final recommendation based on the reasoning above]
</recommendation>
```

**Update All Existing Agents**:
```bash
# Script to add chain-of-thought to all agents
for file in .claude/agents/roles/*.md .claude/agents/specialists/*.md; do
    # Insert reasoning protocol after "## Core Responsibilities" section
    # (Manual review recommended before committing)
done
```

**Success Metrics**:
- All agent outputs include explicit reasoning
- Recommendations confidence scores increase
- Fewer back-and-forth clarifications needed

---

### 1.2 Implement Evaluator-Optimizer Quality Workflow

**Current State**: QA exists, but no formal iterative improvement loop
**Anthropic Pattern**: Evaluator-Optimizer workflow from Claude Cookbook
**Impact**: Significantly higher output quality
**Effort**: Medium (4-6 hours)

#### Implementation

**Create New Workflow**: `.claude/workflows/evaluator-optimizer.md`

```markdown
# Evaluator-Optimizer Workflow

## Purpose
Iterative quality improvement through feedback loops

## When to Use
- Code review iterations
- Documentation refinement
- Dashboard design optimization
- Complex analysis validation

## Process

### Step 1: Generate Initial Output
Specialist or role agent creates initial version

### Step 2: Evaluate Quality
Evaluator assesses against criteria:

<evaluation>
**Completeness**: Does it address all requirements? [Score 1-10]
**Correctness**: Are there errors or inaccuracies? [Score 1-10]
**Clarity**: Is it easy to understand? [Score 1-10]
**Performance**: Does it meet performance needs? [Score 1-10]

**Overall Score**: [Average]

**Specific Issues**:
1. [Issue description with location]
2. [Issue description with location]
...

**Improvement Recommendations**:
1. [Specific actionable recommendation]
2. [Specific actionable recommendation]
...
</evaluation>

### Step 3: Optimize Based on Feedback
Optimizer incorporates feedback and produces improved version

### Step 4: Re-Evaluate
Repeat Steps 2-3 until quality threshold met (typically score >= 8.5/10)

### Step 5: Final Validation
User reviews and approves final version

## Example Usage

**Code Review**:
1. Developer agent writes initial code
2. QA Engineer evaluates (finds 3 issues, score 7.5/10)
3. Developer agent fixes issues
4. QA Engineer re-evaluates (score 9.0/10)
5. Approved for deployment

**Documentation**:
1. Documentation expert writes initial docs
2. Business analyst evaluates clarity for stakeholders (score 6.5/10)
3. Documentation expert improves language and examples
4. Business analyst re-evaluates (score 9.5/10)
5. Published to knowledge base
```

**Add to Project Completion Workflow**:

Update `scripts/finish.sh` to include quality evaluation:
```bash
# Before marking project complete, run evaluator-optimizer
echo "Running quality evaluation..."
# Prompt for self-evaluation
# If score < 8.5, iterate improvements
```

**Success Metrics**:
- Final outputs consistently score >= 8.5/10
- Fewer production issues discovered post-deployment
- Stakeholder satisfaction increases

### 1.3 Document Parallel Execution Pattern

**Current State**: Parallelization mentioned but not explicit
**Anthropic Best Practice**: "Invoke all relevant tools simultaneously"
**Impact**: Faster execution for independent tasks
**Effort**: Low (2-3 hours)

#### Implementation

**Add to CLAUDE.md**:
```markdown
## Parallel Execution Pattern

### When to Use Parallel Execution
Use parallel delegation when tasks are **truly independent**:
- ✅ Analyzing multiple repositories simultaneously
- ✅ Consulting multiple specialists on different aspects
- ✅ Processing multiple data sources concurrently
- ❌ Sequential pipeline steps (use chain pattern instead)
- ❌ Dependent operations (later steps need earlier results)

### How to Request Parallel Execution

**Explicit Request**:
"Analyze dbt_cloud, orchestration, and react-sales-journal repositories IN PARALLEL using specialists"

**Result**: Three specialist agents invoked simultaneously, results synthesized

### Implementation Pattern

**Main Claude Coordinates**:
1. Identifies independent subtasks
2. Delegates to specialists in parallel
3. Waits for all results
4. Synthesizes findings

**Example**:
Task: "Investigate dashboard performance issues"

Parallel Delegation:
- tableau-expert: Analyze Tableau dashboard performance
- snowflake-expert: Analyze SQL query performance
- dbt-expert: Analyze dbt model efficiency

Sequential Synthesis:
- Main Claude: Combine findings, identify root cause, recommend solution

### Success Criteria
- Independent tasks complete simultaneously (not sequentially)
- Total execution time = max(subtask_times), not sum(subtask_times)
- Clear synthesis of parallel results
```

**Add to Agent Templates**:
```markdown
## Parallel Coordination Capabilities

When delegating to multiple specialists:
1. Identify which subtasks are independent
2. Explicitly request parallel execution if appropriate
3. Wait for all specialist reports
4. Synthesize findings with clear attribution

Example:
"I need to consult aws-expert and snowflake-expert IN PARALLEL:
- aws-expert: Investigate ECS task failures
- snowflake-expert: Investigate warehouse performance

I'll synthesize results once both reports are received."
```

**Success Metrics**:
- Complex investigations complete 40-60% faster
- Agents explicitly state when using parallel vs sequential execution
- Clear synthesis of parallel findings

---

## Priority 2: MEDIUM IMPACT (Next Quarter)

### 2.1 Implement Orchestrator-Workers Pattern

**Current State**: Pre-defined agent responsibilities
**Anthropic Pattern**: Dynamic task decomposition by orchestrator
**Impact**: Handle unpredictable complex tasks
**Effort**: High (2-3 days)

#### Implementation

**Create New Agent**: `.claude/agents/roles/orchestrator-role.md`

```markdown
# Orchestrator Role Agent

## Purpose
Dynamically decompose complex, unpredictable tasks and coordinate workers

## When to Use This Agent
- Multi-repo deployments with unknown dependencies
- Complex troubleshooting across systems
- Investigations where subtasks can't be predicted upfront
- Problems that don't fit existing role/specialist patterns

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Dynamic Task Analysis
Analyze the task and determine what subtasks are needed:

<analysis>
**Task Understanding**:
[Restate the task]

**Complexity Assessment**:
[Simple/Medium/Complex/Unknown]

**Required Expertise Areas**:
1. [Domain 1]
2. [Domain 2]
...

**Subtask Decomposition**:
[Explain how to break down this specific task]
</analysis>

### 2. Worker Task Generation
Generate specific subtasks for workers:

<tasks>
    <task>
        <worker_type>aws-expert</worker_type>
        <task_description>Investigate ECS deployment failures in production cluster</task_description>
        <expected_output>List of failed deployments with root causes</expected_output>
    </task>
    <task>
        <worker_type>github-sleuth-expert</worker_type>
        <task_description>Review recent commits that might have introduced issues</task_description>
        <expected_output>Potentially problematic commits with analysis</expected_output>
    </task>
</tasks>

### 3. Worker Coordination
- Dispatch tasks to appropriate specialist agents
- Monitor progress and adjust plan if needed
- Collect all worker results

### 4. Result Synthesis
Combine worker findings into coherent solution:

<synthesis>
**Worker Findings Summary**:
- aws-expert: [Key findings]
- github-sleuth-expert: [Key findings]

**Root Cause Analysis**:
[Combined analysis]

**Recommended Solution**:
[Actionable recommendations]

**Confidence Level**: [High/Medium/Low]
</synthesis>

## Delegation Pattern
Unlike role agents (which have pre-defined specialists), orchestrator:
1. Analyzes task to determine needed expertise
2. Generates custom subtasks on the fly
3. Selects appropriate specialists dynamically
4. Synthesizes results with cross-domain insights

## Example Usage

**User Request**: "Production deployment failed and users are reporting issues"

**Orchestrator Analysis**:
- This is complex and unpredictable
- Could involve infrastructure, code, data, or configuration
- Need to investigate multiple areas simultaneously

**Generated Subtasks**:
1. aws-expert: Check infrastructure health
2. github-sleuth-expert: Review recent deployments
3. snowflake-expert: Check data pipeline status
4. slack integration: Get user reports

**Synthesis**: Identifies root cause from combined findings
```

**Add Orchestrator Prompt Templates**: `.claude/prompts/orchestration/`

```markdown
# orchestrator-decomposition-prompt.md

You are analyzing a complex task that requires dynamic decomposition.

Task: {{TASK}}

Your goal:
1. Understand the task complexity and scope
2. Identify what expertise areas are needed
3. Break down into specific subtasks for specialists
4. Determine if subtasks can run in parallel or must be sequential

Provide your analysis in this format:

<analysis>
[Your step-by-step reasoning about the task]
</analysis>

<tasks>
    <task>
        <worker_type>[Specialist type]</worker_type>
        <task_description>[Specific task]</task_description>
        <expected_output>[What the worker should produce]</expected_output>
        <dependencies>[Other tasks this depends on, or "none"]</dependencies>
    </task>
    ...
</tasks>

<execution_plan>
**Parallel Tasks**: [List tasks that can run simultaneously]
**Sequential Phases**: [Describe ordering if dependencies exist]
**Estimated Completion**: [Time estimate]
</execution_plan>
```

**Success Metrics**:
- Complex issues resolved without predefined playbook
- Dynamic task decomposition matches quality of manual planning
- Orchestrator pattern used 5-10 times per quarter for novel problems

### 2.2 Enhance MCP Tool Error Handling

**Current State**: MCP tools used extensively, but error handling not documented
**Anthropic Best Practice**: Graceful degradation and fallbacks
**Impact**: Increased reliability
**Effort**: Medium (3-4 hours)

#### Implementation

**Add to All Specialist Agents**:
```markdown
## MCP Tool Execution & Error Handling

### Standard Execution Pattern
1. Recommend MCP tool call with specific parameters
2. Main Claude executes tool
3. Receive and analyze results
4. Provide recommendations based on results

### Error Handling Protocol

**Level 1 - MCP Tool Failure**:
If MCP tool returns error or times out:
- Recommend CLI/SDK fallback with exact commands
- Example: `mcp__aws-api__call_aws` fails → `aws cli` command

**Level 2 - CLI Fallback Failure**:
If CLI also fails:
- Recommend Python/Node.js script approach
- Provide working code example

**Level 3 - All Automated Methods Fail**:
If automation impossible:
- Recommend manual process with step-by-step instructions
- Document limitation for future tool improvement

### Examples

**AWS ECS Service Status**:
```markdown
Primary: mcp__aws-api__call_aws(cli_command="aws ecs describe-services ...")
Fallback 1: AWS CLI directly via Bash tool
Fallback 2: Python boto3 script
Fallback 3: Manual AWS Console check (provide screenshots)
```

**GitHub Issue Creation**:
```markdown
Primary: mcp__github__create_issue(owner="...", repo="...", ...)
Fallback 1: gh CLI command via Bash
Fallback 2: curl API request
Fallback 3: Manual GitHub web interface (provide template)
```

### Documentation
Document each error and successful fallback in findings:

```markdown
ERROR-FIX: mcp__snowflake-mcp__run_query timeout -> Direct snowsql connection worked
ERROR-FIX: github MCP authentication failed -> gh CLI with token succeeded
```

These become knowledge for future similar situations.
```

**Success Metrics**:
- MCP tool failures don't block progress
- Clear fallback paths for every critical operation
- Error-fix patterns accumulated in knowledge base

### 2.3 Create Reusable Prompt Library

**Current State**: Slash commands exist, but no shared prompt components
**Anthropic Best Practice**: Build library of proven approaches
**Impact**: Faster, more consistent agent performance
**Effort**: Medium (4-5 hours)

#### Implementation

**Create Directory Structure**:
```
.claude/prompts/
├── README.md
├── analysis/
│   ├── chain-of-thought.md
│   ├── root-cause-analysis.md
│   ├── impact-assessment.md
│   └── stakeholder-analysis.md
├── generation/
│   ├── documentation.md
│   ├── test-cases.md
│   ├── error-messages.md
│   └── commit-messages.md
├── evaluation/

│   └── user-experience.md
└── orchestration/
    ├── task-decomposition.md
    ├── parallel-coordination.md
    └── result-synthesis.md
```

**Example Prompt Component**: `.claude/prompts/analysis/root-cause-analysis.md`
```markdown
# Root Cause Analysis Prompt Template

## Purpose
Systematic investigation to identify underlying cause of issues

## Usage
Include this template when agents need to diagnose problems

## Template

You are conducting a root cause analysis for: {{PROBLEM_DESCRIPTION}}

Follow the 5 Whys technique:

1. **Symptom**: What is the observable problem?
   {{SYMPTOM}}

2. **Why #1**: Why is this happening?
   [Your analysis]

3. **Why #2**: Why does that cause the symptom?
   [Your analysis]

4. **Why #3**: Why does that condition exist?
   [Your analysis]

5. **Why #4**: Why wasn't this prevented?
   [Your analysis]

6. **Why #5 (Root Cause)**: What is the fundamental issue?
   [Your analysis]

**Root Cause Summary**:
[Clear statement of root cause]

**Verification**:
If we fix the root cause, will the symptom disappear? [Yes/No with reasoning]

**Recommended Fix**:
[Specific action to address root cause]
```

**Reference from Agents**:
```markdown
When performing root cause analysis, use the prompt template:
`.claude/prompts/analysis/root-cause-analysis.md`
```

**Success Metrics**:
- 15-20 reusable prompt components created
- Agents reference prompts consistently
- Higher quality, more consistent outputs

---

## Priority 3: LOW IMPACT (Future Iterations)

### 3.1 Agent-Level Token Budgets

**Effort**: Low (1-2 hours)
**Impact**: Low (optimization, not critical)

Add to agent templates:
```markdown
## Token Budget Guidelines
- Specialist reports: Target <2,000 tokens
- Role agent coordination: Target <3,000 tokens
- Pattern documentation: Target <500 tokens
- Use links instead of duplicating content
```

---

### 3.2 Event-Driven Memory Consolidation

**Effort**: Medium (3-4 hours)
**Impact**: Low (already automated daily/weekly)

Trigger consolidation scripts when:
- Project marked complete via `/complete`
- Large findings file created
- Token usage spike detected

---

### 3.3 Team Learning Metrics Dashboard

**Effort**: High (1-2 weeks)
**Impact**: Low (nice-to-have analytics)

Create dashboard tracking:
- Agent usage frequency
- Success rates by agent type
- Common failure patterns
- Improvement over time

---
