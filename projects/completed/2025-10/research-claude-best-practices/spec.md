# Research Specification: Claude Best Practices

## Objective
Conduct comprehensive research on Claude best practices to enhance da-agent-hub's Claude environment configuration, focusing on official Anthropic sources.

## Research Scope

### Primary Sources (Weighted Highest)
1. **Anthropic Official Documentation**
   - Claude Code documentation
   - Claude API documentation
   - Prompt engineering guides
   - Model capabilities and limitations

2. **Claude Cookbook**
   - Proven patterns and recipes
   - Multi-agent architectures
   - Tool use patterns
   - Real-world implementations

### Secondary Sources
