## What's Ready to Use NOW

### Immediate Use (Templates Active)
1. **Chain-of-Thought** - All new agent instances automatically include reasoning protocol
2. **Evaluator-Optimizer** - Workflow documented, ready to use on next quality-critical task
3. **Parallel Execution** - Guidance in CLAUDE.md, use "IN PARALLEL" explicitly in delegations
4. **Orchestrator** - New role available for complex, unpredictable multi-domain tasks

### Available for Reference
5. **Task Decomposition Template** - Use when orchestrating complex tasks
6. **Prompt Library Structure** - Foundation for team to add proven patterns

## What's Deferred (Lower Priority)

### Not Implemented (Can Add Later)
- Individual specialist updates with MCP error handling examples (foundation in templates)

## Post-Implementation Improvements

### Memory Health Check Fix (October 15, 2025)

**Issue**: The memory health check script (`scripts/check-memory-health.py`) required the `tiktoken` Python module but encountered `ModuleNotFoundError` due to system Python being externally managed by Homebrew.

**Solution**: Created wrapper script `scripts/check-memory-health-uvx.sh` using `uvx` to automatically handle the tiktoken dependency in an ephemeral environment.

**Files Updated**:
- **NEW**: `scripts/check-memory-health-uvx.sh` - Wrapper script using uvx
- **UPDATED**: `CLAUDE.md` Session Start Protocol - References new wrapper with updated usage

**Memory System Status (Verified)**:
- **Total Active Memory**: 49,914 tokens (25% of 200K limit)
- **Global Scope**: 49,914 tokens (19 files)
- **Agent-Specific Scope**: 609,198 tokens (183 files across specialists and roles)
- **Total System Memory**: 659,112 tokens (202 files)
- **Status**: ✅ HEALTHY - Prompt caching approach optimal
- **Memory Optimizations**: Working effectively (91.7% token reduction from full corpus)

**Usage**:
```bash
# Standard health check
./scripts/check-memory-health-uvx.sh

# Detailed breakdown
./scripts/check-memory-health-uvx.sh --detailed

# Growth trends
./scripts/check-memory-health-uvx.sh --history
```

**Impact**: Memory health monitoring now accessible without venv management, confirming memory optimizations are working as designed.

**Ready for**: Immediate adoption, impact measurement, continuous improvement
