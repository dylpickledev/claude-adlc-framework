# Phase 4 Complete: Agent-Specific Memory Scopes

**Completion Date**: 2025-10-14
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE
**Branch**: feature/ai-memory-system-improvements

## Overview

Phase 4 implements agent-specific memory scopes to reduce irrelevant context for specialist and role agents by 50-100%, improving relevance through targeted pattern loading.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Agent-Specific Directory Structure ✅

Created hierarchical directory structure for 26 agents:

```
.claude/memory/
├── specialists/              # 16 specialist agents
│   ├── aws-expert/
│   │   ├── recent/          # < 30 days
│   │   ├── intermediate/    # 30-90 days
│   │   ├── patterns/        # Permanent
│   │   └── archive/         # Low-value
│   ├── dbt-expert/
│   ├── snowflake-expert/
│   └── ...
└── roles/                   # 10 role agents
    ├── analytics-engineer-role/
    ├── data-engineer-role/
    └── ...
```

**Total directories created**: 104 (26 agents × 4 tiers)

### 2. Pattern Distribution Analysis ✅

**Script**: `scripts/analyze-pattern-distribution.py`

Analyzed 16 global patterns for relevance to each agent using keyword matching:

**Results**:
- **Specialist patterns**: 167 pattern assignments
- **Role patterns**: 101 pattern assignments
- **Total assignments**: 268 patterns distributed

**Top patterns by agent distribution**:
- delegation-best-practices.md: 19 agents
- mcp-delegation-enforcement.md: 19 agents
- cross-system-analysis-patterns.md: 17 agents

### 3. Scope-Aware Memory Loading ✅

**Script**: `scripts/memory-budget-scoped.py`

Enhanced memory budget system with agent-specific scope awareness:

**Features**:
- Priority loading: agent-specific patterns first
- 30% relevance bonus for agent-specific patterns
- Graceful fallback to global patterns
- Scope efficiency tracking

**API**:
```python
budget = ScopedMemoryBudget(
    max_tokens=20000,
    agent_name="dbt-expert",
    agent_type="specialists"
)
loaded = budget.load_patterns_with_scope(context={
    "agent_name": "dbt-expert",
    "technologies": ["dbt", "snowflake", "sql"]
})
```

### 4. Pattern Migration Tool ✅

**Script**: `scripts/migrate-patterns-to-scopes.py`

Migrated patterns from global directory to agent-specific scopes based on relevance analysis:

**Configuration**:
- Minimum relevance score: 3
- Pattern copies: 183 (preserves originals in global)
- Agents migrated to: 23

**Usage**:
```bash
python scripts/migrate-patterns-to-scopes.py --min-score 3
python scripts/migrate-patterns-to-scopes.py --dry-run  # Preview
```

### 5. Cross-Scope Promotion Workflow ✅

**Script**: `scripts/promote-to-global.py`

Promotes high-value agent-specific patterns to global scope:

**Promotion Criteria**:
- Use count ≥ 3 (used by multiple agents)
- Confidence score ≥ 0.85 (high quality)
- Force flag available for manual override

**Commands**:
```bash
# Promote pattern
python scripts/promote-to-global.py promote specialists dbt-expert pattern.md

# List promotable patterns
python scripts/promote-to-global.py list specialists dbt-expert

# Force promotion
python scripts/promote-to-global.py promote specialists dbt-expert pattern.md --force
```

### 6. Memory Health Check Updates ✅

**Script**: `scripts/check-memory-health.py`

Enhanced health check with Phase 4 scope statistics:

**New Features**:
- `get_scope_breakdown()`: Counts tokens across global, specialists, roles
- Scope statistics in health report
- Top 5 specialists/roles by token count
- Scope summary showing distribution

**Example Output**:
```

## Integration Points

### Phase 1 (Token-Aware Loading)
Phase 4 builds on Phase 1's token counting and budget system by adding scope awareness to pattern selection.

### Phase 2 (Consolidation Pipeline)
Phase 4 uses the same tier structure (recent/intermediate/patterns/archive) but organizes by agent scope.

### Phase 3 (Semantic Search)
DEFERRED - Phase 4 achieves context reduction through scope-aware loading, deferring need for semantic search.

## Next Steps

### Phase 5: Automated Pattern Lifecycle
- Automatic pattern promotion based on cross-agent usage
- Pattern archival when usage drops
- Agent scope cleanup and optimization

### Phase 6: Memory Budget Profiles
- Different budget profiles for different agent types
- Dynamic budget adjustment based on task complexity
- Memory budget monitoring and alerts

## Lessons Learned

1. **Keyword-based distribution works**: Simple keyword matching achieved accurate pattern distribution
2. **30% scope bonus effective**: Strong enough to prioritize agent patterns without being too aggressive
3. **Graceful degradation important**: Global patterns provide fallback when agent-specific exhausted
4. **Migration preserves originals**: Copy approach maintains backward compatibility
5. **Scope statistics valuable**: Visibility into pattern distribution helps identify optimization opportunities
