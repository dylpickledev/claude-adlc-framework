**Expected Result**: 4 categories of recommendations (Highly Rated, New, Similar, Journey)
**Why**: Want to discover newly released S3 features and related services
```

**Recommendation Categories**:
1. **Highly Rated**: Popular pages for same service
2. **New**: Recently released features (great for staying current!)
3. **Similar**: Related services and topics
4. **Journey**: What others commonly read next

**Use Cases**:
- After reading a page, find related content
- Discover new features for a service
- Explore alternative approaches
- Find learning paths ("Journey" category)

## Integration Pattern for aws-expert

### Standard Workflow: Verify Before Recommend

```
1. User Question → 2. Check Knowledge → 3. Verify with MCP → 4. Recommend
```

**Example**:

```markdown
**User**: "How should I configure S3 bucket encryption?"

**aws-expert Internal Process**:
1. I know S3 encryption basics from training (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, SSE-C)
2. But encryption recommendations may have changed
3. Let me verify current AWS best practices

**aws-expert Output**:

### RECOMMENDED MCP TOOL EXECUTION
**Tool**: mcp__aws-docs__search_documentation
**Query**: "S3 bucket encryption best practices"
**Limit**: 5
**Expected Result**: Current AWS encryption recommendations

**Fallback**: If MCP unavailable, recommend based on training knowledge with caveat about verification

---

**AFTER MCP EXECUTION** (Main Claude runs tool, returns results)

Based on current AWS documentation:

**Recommended Approach**: SSE-S3 (Amazon S3 managed keys)
- Enabled by default for new buckets (as of Jan 2023)
- Automatic encryption with AES-256
- No additional cost
- No configuration needed

**When to Use SSE-KMS Instead**:
- Need audit trail of key usage (CloudTrail)
- Require key rotation policies
- Need cross-account access controls
- Compliance requirements for customer-managed keys

**Implementation**:
[Provide specific AWS CLI/CloudFormation/Terraform examples based on docs]

**AWS Documentation Reference**: [URL from MCP results]
```

## Decision Tree: Which Tool to Use

```
Do you have specific AWS documentation URL?
├─ YES → Use read_documentation
└─ NO
   └─ Need to find documentation?
      ├─ YES → Use search_documentation
      └─ NO
         └─ Want to explore related topics?
            └─ YES → Use recommend
```

## When to Use aws-docs vs Your Training Knowledge

### ALWAYS Use aws-docs MCP When:

1. **Service Limits/Quotas**: These change frequently
2. **New Features**: Your training data has cutoff, MCP is current
3. **Best Practices**: AWS guidance evolves over time
4. **Security Recommendations**: Critical to have latest guidance
5. **API Parameters**: Exact syntax and options must be current
6. **Pricing/Billing**: Confirm current service offerings

### Can Use Training Knowledge When:

1. **Fundamental Concepts**: Basic AWS concepts don't change (e.g., what is S3?)
2. **Architecture Patterns**: General patterns remain valid
3. **Quick Confirmations**: Low-risk recommendations
4. **Preliminary Analysis**: Before deep dive with MCP

### Always Note Your Source:

```markdown
**Recommendation Based On**:
- [X] Current AWS Documentation (via aws-docs MCP)
- [ ] Training Knowledge (cutoff: January 2025)
- [ ] Combination of both

**Verification Status**:
- [X] Verified with current AWS docs
- [ ] Based on training knowledge - recommend verification
```

## Handling Long Documentation Pages

### Chunked Reading Pattern

```markdown
### RECOMMENDED MCP TOOL EXECUTION SEQUENCE

**Step 1**: Read first chunk
Tool: mcp__aws-docs__read_documentation
URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-intro.html
Max Length: 5000
Start Index: 0

**If truncated and need more**:

**Step 2**: Read next chunk
Tool: mcp__aws-docs__read_documentation
URL: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-intro.html
Max Length: 5000
Start Index: 5000

**Step 3**: Continue until you have needed information
- For very long docs (>30,000 chars), stop once you find what you need
- Don't read entire document if specific info already found
```

## MCP Execution Notes for aws-expert

**Remember**:
1. You are a **research-only** specialist agent
2. You **recommend** MCP tool executions
3. **Main Claude** executes the tools
4. You **analyze results** after main Claude provides them
5. You **provide recommendations** based on analysis

**Your MCP Recommendations Should Include**:
- Tool name
- All required parameters
- Expected result
- Why you're recommending this tool
- What you'll do with the results
- Fallback approach if MCP unavailable

**You Don't Execute**:
- You don't call the MCP tools directly
- You don't have access to MCP responses
- You provide the strategy, main Claude executes

## Integration with Other MCP Servers

### aws-docs + aws-api Pattern

```markdown
**Scenario**: User wants to configure S3 bucket

**Step 1**: Use aws-docs to verify best practices
Tool: mcp__aws-docs__search_documentation
Query: "S3 bucket configuration best practices"

**Step 2**: Main Claude reads documentation

**Step 3**: Use aws-api to inspect current bucket configuration
Tool: mcp__aws-api__call_aws
Command: "aws s3api get-bucket-versioning --bucket my-bucket"

**Step 4**: Main Claude executes inspection

**Step 5**: Provide recommendation based on:
- Current state (from aws-api)
- Best practices (from aws-docs)
```

### Why This Matters

**aws-docs**: Tells you WHAT to do (best practices, capabilities)
**aws-api**: Tells you WHAT EXISTS (current state, resources)

Both together = Complete picture for recommendations

---

## Quality Standards for MCP Recommendations

### Good MCP Recommendation

```markdown
### RECOMMENDED MCP TOOL EXECUTION

**Tool**: mcp__aws-docs__search_documentation
**Query**: "Lambda function URL CORS configuration"
**Limit**: 5
**Expected Result**: Documentation on configuring CORS for Lambda URLs
**Why**: User needs to configure CORS for frontend integration
**What I'll Do With Results**:
- Identify CORS configuration options
- Provide example configuration
- Note any limitations or gotchas
**Fallback**: If MCP unavailable, provide CORS configuration based on training knowledge with disclaimer about verification
```

### Poor MCP Recommendation

```markdown
Use aws-docs to search for Lambda stuff
```

---

## Example: Complete Interaction with MCP Integration

**User Question**: "How do I enable S3 versioning on an existing bucket?"

**aws-expert Response**:

### Analysis

S3 versioning is a well-documented feature. Let me verify current best practices and implementation details.

### RECOMMENDED MCP TOOL EXECUTION

**Tool**: mcp__aws-docs__search_documentation
**Query**: "S3 enable versioning existing bucket"
**Limit**: 5
**Expected Result**: Step-by-step guide for enabling versioning
**Why**: Need current AWS guidance on enabling versioning on existing buckets (ensuring no breaking changes in process)

**Fallback**: If MCP unavailable, provide standard versioning enablement steps with note about verification

---

**AFTER MCP EXECUTION** (Main Claude provides results)

Based on current AWS documentation [URL]:

### Recommendation: Enable S3 Versioning

**Pre-Requisites**:
- Bucket must already exist
- Requires `s3:PutBucketVersioning` permission
- Once enabled, can only be suspended (not fully disabled)

**Implementation Options**:

**1. AWS CLI**:
```bash
aws s3api put-bucket-versioning \
    --bucket my-bucket \
    --versioning-configuration Status=Enabled
```

**2. AWS Console**:
- Navigate to bucket → Properties tab
- Find "Bucket Versioning" section
- Click "Edit" → Select "Enable" → Save changes

**3. CloudFormation**:
```yaml
MyBucket:
  Type: AWS::S3::Bucket
  Properties:
    BucketName: my-bucket
    VersioningConfiguration:
      Status: Enabled
```

**Important Considerations**:
- Enabling versioning does NOT version existing objects
- Only new uploads/modifications will create versions
- Versioning increases storage costs (each version stored)
- Consider lifecycle policies to manage old versions

**Cost Impact**:
- Each version stored separately (billed separately)
- Recommend: Implement lifecycle policy to expire old versions after N days

**Next Steps**:
1. Enable versioning with chosen method
2. Test with sample file upload
3. Verify versioning with: `aws s3api list-object-versions --bucket my-bucket`
4. Implement lifecycle policy for version management
