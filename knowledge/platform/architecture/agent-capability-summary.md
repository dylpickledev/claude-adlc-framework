3. **BI Developer** - Tableau/Power BI dashboards, enterprise reporting
4. **UI/UX Developer** - Streamlit/React applications, data interfaces
5. **Data Architect** - Platform strategy, system design, technology selection
6. **Business Analyst** - Requirements gathering, stakeholder alignment
7. **QA Engineer** - Testing strategies, data quality validation
8. **Project Manager** - Delivery coordination, UAT frameworks

## ðŸš€ Key Capabilities

### 1. Cross-System Orchestration
Coordinate work across AWS + Snowflake + dbt + Tableau + GitHub with specialist delegation:
```
Role Agent (e.g., Analytics Engineer)
    â†“ Delegates to specialists when needed
Specialists (dbt-expert, snowflake-expert)
    â†“ Use MCP tools for validated recommendations
Main Claude executes MCP calls + implements recommendations
```

### 2. End-to-End Application Delivery
- **UI/UX Developer** â†’ React/Streamlit development
- **aws-expert** â†’ ECS deployment, ALB configuration, Docker builds
- **github-sleuth-expert** â†’ Issue tracking, PR workflows
- **QA Engineer** â†’ Testing validation

### 3. Production-Validated Patterns
Specialists maintain confidence scores for proven patterns:
- **ALB OIDC Authentication** (confidence: 0.95) - Production-validated
- **ECS Multi-Service Deployment** (confidence: 0.90) - Sales Journal app
- **dbt Semantic Layer** (confidence: 0.85) - Analytics engineering

### 4. Knowledge-Driven Decision Making
Three-tier documentation architecture:
- **Tier 1**: Lightweight repo READMEs (developer quick-start)
- **Tier 2**: Comprehensive knowledge base (`knowledge/applications/`)
- **Tier 3**: Agent pattern indexes (confidence + pointers)

### 5. Automated Quality Assurance
- **QA Engineer** delegates to data-quality-specialist
- dbt testing architecture via `dbt-mcp`
- Snowflake validation via `snowflake-mcp`
- GitHub issue creation for tracking

### 6. Cost Optimization
- **cost-optimization-specialist** analyzes Snowflake, AWS, Tableau spending
- Cross-platform recommendations
- Warehouse sizing, compute pool optimization

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Production Applications

### Known Deployed Systems
1. **Sales Journal** (React + FastAPI)
   - ECS deployment, ALB OIDC auth, multi-service Docker
   - Full knowledge base: `knowledge/applications/sales-journal/`

2. **App Portal** (React + Node.js)

- No hardcoded credentials

---

## ðŸ’¡ Continuous Learning System

### Chat Analysis & Improvement
- Privacy-preserving conversation analysis
- Effectiveness metrics extraction
- Automatic pattern discovery via `/complete`
- Agent capability enhancement recommendations

---

## ðŸš§ Known Limitations

1. **Azure Integration**: azure-expert defined but no MCP server yet
2. **Tableau MCP**: Limited functionality compared to other platforms
3. **Orchestra/Prefect MCPs**: Custom implementations, not official
4. **Production Validation**: Some patterns remain confidence <0.80

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Effectiveness Metrics

- **15x Token Cost Justified**: Specialist consultation yields significantly better outcomes (Anthropic research)
- **Correctness > Speed**: Production-ready code on first attempt
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Pattern extraction from every completed project
- **Cross-System Coordination**: Eliminate manual integration work
