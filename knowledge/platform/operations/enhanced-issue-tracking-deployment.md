# Enhanced Issue Tracking System - Deployment Guide

## Overview

This guide walks through deploying the enhanced issue tracking system with Claude-powered classification across **dbt_cloud**, **roy_kent**, and **da-agent-hub** repositories.

## Prerequisites

### Required Secrets
Each repository needs the following secrets configured:

#### In da-agent-hub repository:
```bash
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_claude_oauth_token
GITHUB_TOKEN=automatically_provided
DA_AGENT_HUB_PAT=personal_access_token_with_workflow_permissions
```

#### In dbt repositories (dbt_cloud, roy_kent):
```bash
DBT_CLOUD_API_TOKEN=your_dbt_cloud_token
DBT_CLOUD_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id
GITHUB_TOKEN=automatically_provided
DA_AGENT_HUB_PAT=personal_access_token_for_cross_repo_triggers
```

### Required Permissions
- The `DA_AGENT_HUB_PAT` token needs:
  - `repo` scope for all repositories
  - `workflow` scope for triggering workflows
  - `issues` scope for creating and managing issues

## Deployment Steps

### Phase 1: Deploy Core Agents (da-agent-hub)

1. **Deploy the new specialized agents**:
   ```bash
   # These files should already be created in da-agent-hub
   .claude/agents/github-sleuth-expert.md
   .claude/agents/issue-lifecycle-expert.md
   ```

2. **Deploy the classification workflows**:
   ```bash
   # Copy these files to da-agent-hub/.github/workflows/
   claude-error-classifier.yml
   auto-resolution-monitor.yml
   cross-repository-coordination.yml
   ```

3. **Test the agents**:
   ```bash
   # In da-agent-hub, test the new agents
   claude "using github-sleuth-expert, analyze recent issues in dbt_cloud"
   claude "using issue-lifecycle-expert, review our current workflow automation"
   ```

### Phase 2: Update Repository Monitoring (dbt_cloud & roy_kent)

1. **Update each dbt repository with enhanced monitoring**:
   ```bash
   # In dbt_cloud repository
   cp da-agent-hub/templates/enhanced-dbt-error-monitor.yml .github/workflows/dbt-error-monitor.yml

   # In roy_kent repository
   cp da-agent-hub/templates/enhanced-dbt-error-monitor.yml .github/workflows/dbt-error-monitor.yml
   ```

2. **Verify workflow permissions**:
   - Ensure each repository can trigger workflows in da-agent-hub
   - Test the `DA_AGENT_HUB_PAT` token has proper permissions

### Phase 3: Configure Cross-Repository Coordination

1. **Set up repository-specific labels** in each repository:
   ```bash
   # Create standard labels for classification
   gh label create "claude:classified" --color "0E8A16" --description "Issue has been classified by Claude"
   gh label create "category:transient_failure" --color "F9D71C" --description "Self-resolving error"
   gh label create "category:code_fix_required" --color "D73A4A" --description "Requires code changes"
   gh label create "category:data_quality_issue" --color "FF8C00" --description "Data quality problem"
   gh label create "category:infrastructure_issue" --color "8B0000" --description "Platform/infrastructure issue"
   gh label create "category:false_positive" --color "CCCCCC" --description "Not a real error"
   gh label create "priority:critical" --color "B60205" --description "Critical priority"
   gh label create "priority:high" --color "D93F0B" --description "High priority"
   gh label create "priority:medium" --color "FBCA04" --description "Medium priority"
   gh label create "priority:low" --color "0E8A16" --description "Low priority"
   ```

2. **Configure repository-specific automation rules**:

   **dbt_cloud** (Production Critical):
   ```yaml
   # Add to repository description or README
   Repository Priority: CRITICAL
   SLA: 4 hours for critical issues
   Auto-assign: dbt-expert for schema/compilation errors
   Escalation: Immediate for P0 issues
   ```

   **roy_kent** (Business Intelligence):
   ```yaml
   # Add to repository description or README
   Repository Priority: HIGH
   SLA: 24 hours for business impact
   Auto-assign: dbt-expert for metrics, tableau-expert for dashboards
   Business notification: Required for metric calculation errors
   ```

### Phase 4: Test the Complete System

1. **Create a test error issue** in dbt_cloud:
   ```bash
   gh issue create \
     --title "Test Error: Model compilation failed for stg_test_customers" \
     --body "Error during dbt run: column 'customer_id' does not exist in relation 'raw_customers'" \
     --label "dbt-error"
   ```

2. **Verify the automated workflow**:
   - Check that Claude classification is triggered
   - Verify proper labels are applied
   - Confirm expert assignment occurs
   - Test cross-repository coordination

3. **Test transient failure detection**:
   ```bash
   # Create an issue that mimics a transient failure
   gh issue create \
     --title "Test Transient: Warehouse timeout during model run" \
     --body "dbt run failed with: timeout waiting for warehouse connection" \
     --label "dbt-error"
   ```

4. **Monitor auto-resolution**:
   - Wait for the 6-hour auto-resolution check
   - Verify transient issues are properly closed
   - Check that resolution patterns are tracked

## Configuration Customization

### Repository-Specific Rules

Edit the classification prompts in `claude-error-classifier.yml` to customize repository-specific behavior:

```yaml
# For dbt_cloud - stricter SLAs
critical_error_types:
  - compilation_failure
  - schema_mismatch
  - test_failure_blocking

# For roy_kent - business impact focus
business_critical_types:
  - metric_calculation_error
  - dashboard_data_missing
  - semantic_layer_failure
```

### Expert Assignment Rules

Customize expert assignment in the classification prompts:

```yaml
assignment_rules:
  dbt_model_errors: "dbt-expert"
  warehouse_performance: "snowflake-expert"
  dashboard_issues: "tableau-expert"
  workflow_failures: "github-sleuth-expert"
  cross_system_issues: "da-architect"
```

### Escalation Thresholds

Adjust escalation rules in `cross-repository-coordination.yml`:

```yaml
escalation_triggers:
  high_volume_threshold: 5 # issues per day
  critical_response_time: 4 # hours
  recurring_issue_threshold: 3 # occurrences
  cross_repo_correlation_threshold: 2 # related issues
```

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Response Time Metrics**:
   - Time to first classification: Target < 2 hours
   - Time to expert assignment: Target < 4 hours
   - Time to first response: Target < 8 hours

2. **Classification Accuracy**:
   - Auto-resolution rate for transient failures: Target > 30%
   - Expert assignment accuracy: Target > 90%
   - False positive reduction: Target > 50%

3. **System Health Indicators**:
   - Total issue volume trends
   - Resolution time improvements
   - Expert workload distribution

### Monitoring Dashboard

Create issues in da-agent-hub to track system performance:

```bash
# Weekly metrics review
gh issue create \
  --title "Weekly Issue Tracking Metrics - $(date '+%Y-%m-%d')" \
  --body "Review classification accuracy, resolution times, and system health" \
  --label "metrics,weekly-review" \
  --assignee "claude[bot]"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Classification not triggering**:
   ```bash
   # Check workflow permissions
   gh workflow list --repo your-org/claude-adlc-framework

   # Verify secrets are configured
   gh secret list --repo your-org/your-data-repo
   ```

2. **Cross-repository triggers failing**:
   ```bash
   # Test PAT token permissions
   curl -H "Authorization: token $FRAMEWORK_PAT" \
        -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
        https://api.github.com/repos/your-org/claude-adlc-framework/actions/workflows
   ```

3. **Agent not responding correctly**:
   ```bash
   # Test agents locally
   claude "using github-sleuth-expert, test classification capabilities"
   claude "using issue-lifecycle-expert, review automation rules"
   ```

### Debugging Workflows

Enable debug logging in GitHub Actions:

```yaml
# Add to workflow files for debugging
env:
  ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG: true
  ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: true
```

## Maintenance
