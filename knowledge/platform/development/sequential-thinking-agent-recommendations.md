## Priority Recommendations

### Tier 1: HIGH PRIORITY (Always Use Sequential Thinking)

#### 1. Data Architect (`data-architect-role`)

**Why High Priority**:
- Strategic decisions with long-term impact
- Technology selection requiring trade-off analysis
- Cross-system integration planning
- Multiple viable approaches requiring exploration
- High cost of wrong decisions

**Recommended Use Cases**:
- System architecture design
- Technology evaluation (dbt Cloud vs Prefect vs Orchestra)
- Migration strategy planning
- Platform roadmap development
- Governance framework design

**Integration Pattern**:
```markdown
### Sequential Thinking Integration

When facing strategic decisions or complex system design:

1. **Start sequential thinking** for problems with:
   - Multiple viable approaches
   - Unclear requirements initially
   - High impact of wrong choice
   - Need to show reasoning trail to stakeholders

2. **Use parameters**:
   - Set realistic `totalThoughts` (typically 8-15 for architecture)
   - Use `branchFromThought` to explore alternatives
   - Mark `isRevision: true` when requirements change
   - Set `needsMoreThoughts` if scope expands

3. **Pattern**: Hypothesis Testing
   - Thought 1-3: Requirements + constraints
   - Thought 4-6: Alternative approaches (Branch A, B, C)
   - Thought 7: Evaluation matrix
   - Thought 8: Synthesis + recommendation
```

**Confidence**: 0.95 - Architecture decisions are ideal for sequential thinking

#### 2. QA Engineer (`qa-engineer-role`)

**Why High Priority**:
- Root cause analysis requiring hypothesis testing
- Test strategy development with multiple approaches
- Production debugging where wrong answer is costly
- Need to document investigation trail

**Recommended Use Cases**:
- Production issue investigation
- Test coverage gap analysis
- Performance regression root cause
- Data quality issue diagnosis
- Integration failure troubleshooting

**Integration Pattern**:
```markdown
### Sequential Thinking Integration

When investigating production issues or designing test strategies:

1. **Start sequential thinking** for:
   - Unknown root cause (hypothesis testing needed)
   - Complex integration failures
   - Performance issues requiring investigation
   - Test strategy with multiple viable approaches

2. **Pattern**: Root Cause Analysis
   - Thought 1: Symptom analysis (what, when, how often)
   - Thought 2-3: Hypothesis generation (multiple theories)
   - Thought 4-6: Hypothesis verification (test each)
   - Thought 7: Root cause confirmation
   - Thought 8-9: Solution design + validation

3. **Revision Strategy**:
   - Mark `isRevision: true` when hypothesis disproven
   - Reference `revisesThought` to track failed theories
   - Build on successful verifications
```

**Confidence**: 0.90 - Root cause analysis benefits significantly from structured reasoning

## FAQ

### Q: When should an agent choose sequential thinking over direct response?

**A**: Use the decision matrix:
- **YES** if: Problem scope unclear, multiple approaches viable, high correctness requirement, multi-step reasoning needed
- **NO** if: Simple/well-defined task, quick lookup, time-sensitive, repeatable pattern

### Q: What's the token cost impact?

**A**: Sequential thinking uses ~15x more tokens than direct responses. Justified when:
- Architecture decisions (long-term impact)
- Production debugging (downtime cost high)
- Stakeholder-critical decisions (political/business risk)
- Complex migrations (failure cost high)

### Q: How many thoughts should a typical session use?

**A**: Varies by complexity:
- Simple analysis: 5-8 thoughts
- Architecture decision: 8-15 thoughts
- Complex investigation: 12-20 thoughts
- Adjust `totalThoughts` dynamically as understanding deepens

### Q: When should agents use revisions vs new thoughts?

**A**: Use revisions when:
- Understanding of earlier thought changed
- New information contradicts previous reasoning
- Hypothesis disproven, need to backtrack

Use new thoughts when:
- Building on previous insights (linear progression)
- Adding new perspective (not changing old one)

### Q: Should specialist agents use sequential thinking?

**A**: Sparingly. Specialists focus on execution speed. Use sequential thinking when:
- Investigating/researching unfamiliar patterns
- Multiple implementation approaches viable
- Root cause unknown

Skip for standard implementation tasks.
