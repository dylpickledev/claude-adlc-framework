# Semantic Layer Strategy for Microsoft Copilot Integration

## Executive Summary
Evaluating semantic layer options (dbt, Snowflake Cortex, Power BI) for enabling sales reps to query customer context through Microsoft Copilot, with focus on metric trees and BI-agnostic architecture.

## Current State → Target Vision
- **From**: Raw Snowflake data warehouse
- **To**: "Get me relevant information for customer X" → AI returns emails, documents, metrics

## Semantic Layer Options Analysis

### 1. dbt Semantic Layer (MetricFlow)

**Strengths:**
- **Metric Trees Native**: Built-in support for derived metrics with cascading dependencies
- **BI Agnostic**: Works with 30+ downstream tools via APIs
- **Version Control**: Metrics as code in YAML, full Git integration
- **2024 Features**: Conversion metrics, custom calendars, Python SDK GA
- **Microsoft Integration**: Native Fabric adapter (GA), Power BI connector

**Weaknesses:**
- Requires dbt Cloud (Team/Enterprise) for full features
- Additional infrastructure layer to maintain
- Learning curve for MetricFlow syntax

**Metric Tree Implementation:**
```yaml
metrics:
  - name: customer_ltv
    type: derived
    expr: total_revenue - total_costs
    metrics:
      - name: total_revenue
      - name: total_costs
  
  - name: revenue_per_customer
    type: derived
    expr: total_revenue / customer_count
```

### 2. Snowflake Cortex Semantic Layer

**Strengths:**
- **Native Integration**: Runs directly in Snowflake, no external dependencies
- **AI-Powered**: Cortex Analyst for natural language queries
- **Semantic Views**: New 2024 feature for business concept storage
- **Security**: Data never leaves Snowflake governance boundary

**Weaknesses:**
- Vendor lock-in to Snowflake ecosystem
- Limited BI tool integration compared to dbt
- YAML semantic models limited to 1MB
- Less mature metric tree capabilities

**Architecture:**
- Semantic Views → Cortex Analyst → Natural Language API
- Direct integration with Snowflake data, minimal latency

### 3. Power BI Semantic Models (in Fabric)

**Strengths:**
- **Microsoft Native**: Deep Copilot integration out-of-box
- **Direct Lake**: Query parquet files without import/duplication
- **OneLake Integration**: Unified data platform with Fabric
- **Business User Friendly**: Visual modeling interface

**Weaknesses:**
- Strongest vendor lock-in (Microsoft ecosystem)
- Less code-based version control
- Limited portability to non-Microsoft tools
- Metric definitions less programmatic than dbt

## Decision Framework

### Evaluation Criteria Matrix

| Criteria | Weight | dbt | Snowflake | Power BI |
|----------|--------|-----|-----------|----------|
| **Metric Trees** | 25% | 10 | 7 | 6 |
| **BI Agnostic** | 20% | 10 | 6 | 3 |
| **Copilot Integration** | 20% | 7 | 5 | 10 |
| **Vendor Lock-in** | 15% | 9 | 5 | 3 |
| **Developer Experience** | 10% | 9 | 7 | 6 |
| **Cost** | 10% | 6 | 8 | 7 |

### Strategic Considerations

#### Choose dbt If:
- Metric trees and complex derived metrics are critical
- BI tool independence is mandatory
- Engineering team owns semantic layer
- Version control and CI/CD are priorities

#### Choose Snowflake If:
- Minimizing infrastructure complexity is key
- AI/natural language queries are primary use case
- Already heavily invested in Snowflake
- Data governance must stay in single platform

#### Choose Power BI If:
- Microsoft Copilot is the only consumer
- Business users need self-service modeling
- Already using Microsoft Fabric
- Speed to market trumps flexibility

## Recommended Hybrid Architecture

### Phase 1: Foundation (dbt + Snowflake)
- Build metric trees in dbt for core business logic
- Use Snowflake as compute engine
- Establish version-controlled semantic definitions

### Phase 2: Microsoft Integration
- Sync dbt metrics to Power BI via Fabric adapter
- Create Power BI semantic models for Copilot consumption
- Maintain dbt as source of truth

### Phase 3: Intelligence Layer
- Add Cortex Analyst for ad-hoc natural language queries
- Power BI for structured Copilot interactions
- dbt orchestrates metric consistency across platforms

## Implementation Roadmap

### Month 1-2: Semantic Foundation
- Define core customer metrics in dbt
- Build metric trees for sales context
- Test with development BI tools

### Month 3-4: Microsoft Bridge
- Deploy dbt-fabric adapter
- Create Power BI semantic models
- Configure Copilot plugins

### Month 5-6: Production Rollout
- Train sales team on natural language queries
- Monitor metric consistency
- Iterate on metric definitions

## Key Recommendations

1. **Start with dbt** for metric trees and BI independence
2. **Bridge to Power BI** for Copilot integration
3. **Consider Snowflake Cortex** for future AI capabilities
4. **Maintain single source of truth** in version-controlled YAML

## Next Steps

1. POC: Build sample customer metric tree in dbt
2. Test Microsoft Fabric adapter with existing Snowflake data
3. Evaluate Copilot plugin architecture requirements
4. Assess team skills and training needs

## Questions for Further Investigation

- What's the latency tolerance for Copilot queries?
- How complex are the metric interdependencies?
- What other BI tools need access beyond Copilot?
- What's the budget for semantic layer infrastructure?
