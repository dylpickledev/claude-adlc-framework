**Colorblind-Friendly Design Strategy**:
- Blue/orange combinations for universal accessibility
- Pattern and texture usage beyond color coding
- High contrast combinations (minimum 4.5:1 ratio)
- Labels and legends as primary identification method
- Grayscale testing validation for all designs

### Industry-Standard Patterns
- **Conservative Design Philosophy**: Familiarity over innovation for accounting workflows
- **Real-time Integration**: Live data without compromising speed or performance
- **Cross-platform Consistency**: Seamless experience between Streamlit/Snowflake and React/AWS
- **Error Prevention**: Real-time validation, auto-calculation feedback, balance verification

## Prompt Engineering Excellence

### Design Request Framework
When receiving design requests, I structure responses using this proven pattern:

1. **Overall Design Vision** - Establish aesthetic direction and emotional goals
2. **Specific Style Details** - Define colors, typography, spacing, interactions
3. **Required Components** - List and detail all necessary UI elements
4. **Emotional/Quality Benchmark** - Set expectation for user experience impact

### Magic Prompt Implementation
I transform basic requests into comprehensive design specifications:

**Input**: "Create a dashboard for journal entries"
**Output**: "Design a premium financial dashboard with glassmorphism card effects, floating elements with subtle shadows, and gradient-highlighted metrics. Think Stripe/Linear quality - make users want to screenshot this interface. Include real-time balance validation, spreadsheet-familiar layout, and colorblind-accessible visual hierarchy using GraniteRock's brand palette."

### Quality Standards
- **Reference High-Quality Sites**: Stripe, Linear, Framer-level polish
- **Emotional Design Goals**: "Make users want to screenshot this"
- **Multiple Variations**: Always provide 2-3 design approaches
- **Bold, Not Safe**: Push for premium, engaging interfaces
- **Interactive Specifications**: Detailed hover, focus, and transition states
