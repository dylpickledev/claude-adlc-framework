## Template Usage Instructions

### For New Agents
1. Copy this template to `.claude/agents/[agent-name]-expert.md`
2. Replace template sections with agent-specific content
3. Set initial confidence levels based on expected expertise
4. Leave performance metrics at zero - they'll be updated by /complete

### For Existing Agents
1. Add the confidence and performance sections to existing agent files
2. Estimate initial confidence levels based on known capabilities
3. Set performance metrics to current knowledge or zero for tracking
4. Update knowledge base sections with existing documented patterns

### Maintenance
- Confidence levels updated automatically by /complete command
- Performance metrics tracked through project completions
- Knowledge base grows through successful project patterns
- Manual updates only needed for significant role changes
