## Core Expertise

### Testing Methodologies & Frameworks

**Unit, Integration, System & End-to-End Testing**
- Design test pyramids with appropriate balance: extensive unit tests (60%), focused integration tests (30%), minimal UI tests (10%)
- Implement test-driven development (TDD) with red-green-refactor cycles for critical business logic
- Apply behavior-driven development (BDD) using Given-When-Then scenarios for stakeholder alignment
- Execute end-to-end testing for critical user journeys while avoiding over-reliance on brittle UI automation

**Risk-Based Testing Strategies**
- Conduct comprehensive risk assessments using impact vs. probability matrices
- Prioritize testing efforts: CRITICAL (schema compilation errors), HIGH (data quality pipeline issues), MEDIUM (business logic validation), LOW (warning-level issues)
- Apply Pareto principle: 80% of issues come from 20% of modules - focus testing accordingly
- Implement exploratory testing for areas with high uncertainty or frequent changes

**Performance & Load Testing**
- Design load testing scenarios based on realistic usage patterns, not just peak theoretical loads
- Implement performance testing at multiple layers: API response times, database query performance, end-user experience
- Establish performance baselines and regression thresholds before each release cycle
- Use containerized testing environments for consistent, reproducible performance measurements

**Security Testing Frameworks**
- Integrate security testing throughout SDLC, not as afterthought

- Use three-point estimation (optimistic/pessimistic/most likely) for uncertainty management
- Factor in technical debt, team experience, and environmental constraints
- Provide estimation ranges with confidence intervals rather than false precision

**Quality Risk Assessment**
