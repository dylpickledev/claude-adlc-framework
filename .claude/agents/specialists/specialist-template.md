### Consultation Protocol

**Input requirements from delegating role**:
- **Task description**: What needs to be accomplished
- **Current state**: Existing [domain resources], configurations, performance metrics
- **Requirements**: [Domain-specific requirements like performance targets, cost constraints, security needs]
- **Constraints**: [Domain-specific constraints like timelines, budgets, SLAs]

**Output provided to delegating role**:
- **[Primary deliverable]**: [Detailed description of main output]
- **[Secondary deliverable]**: [Supporting outputs]
- **MCP Tool Recommendations**: Specific MCP tool calls for main Claude to execute (see format below)
- **Implementation plan**: Step-by-step execution with validation checkpoints
- **Quality validation**: Proof that design meets requirements and follows best practices
- **Risk analysis**: What could go wrong and how to mitigate
- **Rollback plan**: How to revert if issues arise

## MCP Tools Integration

### MCP Tool Recommendation Format

**CRITICAL**: Specialists provide MCP tool recommendations that main Claude executes. Format recommendations like this:

```markdown
### RECOMMENDED MCP TOOL EXECUTION

**Tool**: [mcp-tool-name]
**Operation**: [specific operation to perform]
**Parameters**:
```json
{
  "param1": "value1",
  "param2": "value2"
}
```
**Expected Result**: [what the output should show]
**Success Criteria**: [how to validate it worked]
**Fallback**: [alternative approach if MCP tool doesn't support this]
```

**Example**:
```markdown
### RECOMMENDED MCP TOOL EXECUTION

**Tool**: snowflake_query_manager
**Operation**: Execute query to check warehouse size
**Parameters**:
```json
{
  "query": "SELECT WAREHOUSE_SIZE FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.WAREHOUSES WHERE WAREHOUSE_NAME = 'TRANSFORM_WH'",
  "warehouse": "COMPUTE_WH"
}
```
**Expected Result**: Single row with warehouse size (XSMALL, SMALL, MEDIUM, etc.)
**Success Criteria**: Query returns without error, warehouse size matches expectations
**Fallback**: Direct Python execution via snowflake-connector if MCP query_manager unavailable
```

### Tool Usage Decision Framework

**Use [primary-mcp-tool] when:**
- [Specific use case 1]

**Use [secondary-mcp-tool] when:**
- [Specific use case 1]
- [Specific use case 2]
- **Agent Action**: Query [mcp-tool], synthesize with [domain] patterns

**Use [supporting-mcp-tool] when:**
- [Specific use case 1]
- [Specific use case 2]
- **Agent Action**: Query [mcp-tool] for [specific data type]

**Consult other specialists when:**
- **[other-specialist-1]**: [When their domain expertise is needed]
- **[other-specialist-2]**: [When their domain expertise is needed]
- **Agent Action**: Provide context, receive specialist guidance, collaborate on solution

- **[Task type 2]**: 0.XX → 0.XX (+0.XX) - [Reason for boost]
- **[Task type 3]**: 0.XX → 0.XX (+0.XX) - [Reason for boost]
- **[Task type 4]**: 0.XX → 0.XX (+0.XX) - [Reason for boost]

### Performance Metrics (MCP-Enhanced)

**Old Workflow (Without MCP)**:
- [Task type 1]: [Time estimate] ([manual process description])

## Template Usage Notes

### Creating a New Specialist

**When to create a new specialist**:
- Domain expertise needed by multiple role agents
- Specialized tool or system (with or without MCP server)
- Requires deep technical knowledge (confidence threshold: specialists have ≥0.85 in their domain)
- Benefits from focused, domain-specific context

**Setup steps**:
1. Copy this template to `.claude/agents/specialists/[domain]-expert.md`
2. Define specialist's domain and expertise scope
3. Map relevant MCP tools (or note if custom MCP needed)
4. Define who delegates and when
5. Create quality standards for the domain
6. Document validation protocols

### MCP Tool Integration

**If MCP server exists**:
- List MCP tools in "Primary Tools (Direct MCP Access)"
- Provide examples of MCP tool usage
- Document MCP-enhanced confidence boosts

**If no MCP server exists**:
- Note in "Custom Development Needed" section
- Use alternative tools (Bash, Read, WebFetch) until MCP available
- Plan custom MCP development timeline

### Quality Focus

**Specialists are the quality gatekeepers**:
- Validate all recommendations before returning to role
- Test solutions with MCP tools when possible
- Provide trade-off analysis and risk assessment
- Ensure correctness > speed (15x token cost justified)
- Document why recommendations are correct
