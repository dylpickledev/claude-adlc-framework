## Production-Validated Patterns (From Week 3-4 Testing)

### Pattern 1: Deterministic MERGE Operations (Confidence: 0.95)
**Source**: Test 2 - dbt + snowflake optimization (CRITICAL BUG PREVENTION)

**Problem**: Nondeterministic MERGE operations cause Snowflake errors when source query returns duplicate keys

**Solution**:
```sql
{% if is_incremental() %}
    WITH source_data AS (
        SELECT
            sales_transaction_id,
            transaction_date,
            -- ... other columns ...
            MAX(_fivetran_synced) as _fivetran_synced
        FROM {{ ref('stg_sales_transactions') }}
        WHERE transaction_date >= dateadd(day, -3, current_date)
        GROUP BY sales_transaction_id, transaction_date  -- Prevents nondeterministic errors
    )
{% endif %}
```

**Why This Matters**: This bug would cause production failures in incremental models. snowflake-expert caught it during Test 2 validation.

**When to Apply**:
- All incremental models using `incremental_strategy='merge'`
- Any MERGE operations in Snowflake (stored procedures, tasks)
- Window functions that could produce non-deterministic results

**Validation**: Test with duplicate source data, ensure MERGE completes without errors

### Pattern 2: Incremental Test Optimization (Confidence: 0.92)
**Source**: Test 2 - dbt model optimization

**Problem**: Running full test suite on 50M+ row tables takes 10-15 minutes, slows down CI/CD

**Solution**:
```yaml
# Add where clauses to tests - only validate recent data incrementally
data_tests:
  - unique:
      column_name: sales_transaction_id
      config:
        where: "transaction_date >= dateadd(day, -7, current_date)"

  - not_null:
      column_name: customer_id
      config:
        where: "transaction_date >= dateadd(day, -7, current_date)"
```

**Impact**: 80% reduction in test execution time for daily runs

**When to Apply**:
- Large fact tables (10M+ rows) with incremental processing
- Daily test execution in CI/CD pipelines
- Tests that don't require full historical validation

**Validation**: Weekly full-refresh runs execute tests without where clauses (validate complete dataset)

### Pattern 3: Unique Key Validation Pre-Implementation (Confidence: 0.93)
**Source**: Test 2 - dbt expert critical prerequisite

**Problem**: Incremental models REQUIRE unique keys to work correctly, but unique key violations often exist in source data

**Solution (Pre-Implementation Validation)**:
```sql
-- Run BEFORE converting to incremental materialization
SELECT
    sales_transaction_id,
    COUNT(*) as duplicate_count
FROM {{ ref('stg_sales_transactions') }}
GROUP BY sales_transaction_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
```

**dbt Test Equivalent**:
```yaml
models:
  - name: fct_sales_daily
    columns:
      - name: sales_transaction_id
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
```

**When to Apply**:
- ALWAYS before converting models to incremental materialization
- Any model using `unique_key` configuration
- Before implementing MERGE operations

**Validation**: Test must pass (zero duplicates) before proceeding with incremental config

### Pattern 4: Data Freshness Monitoring (Confidence: 0.88)
**Source**: Test 1 - Orchestra pipeline SLA compliance

**Problem**: Pipeline SLAs require 7am completion but no automated freshness validation

**Solution (dbt Freshness Tests)**:
```yaml
sources:
  - name: salesforce
    freshness:
      warn_after: {count: 25, period: hour}
      error_after: {count: 26, period: hour}
    tables:
      - name: accounts
      - name: opportunities
```

**Monitoring Integration**:
- dbt Cloud: Test results in UI + Slack alerts
- Custom: Parse dbt run_results.json, send to CloudWatch metrics

**When to Apply**:
- SLA-critical data sources (daily reports, executive dashboards)
- Source systems with expected refresh schedules
- Cross-system dependencies (downstream models depend on freshness)

**Validation**: Alert triggers correctly during test failures, team receives notifications

### Pattern 5: Test Coverage Targets (Confidence: 0.90)
**Source**: Data quality best practices + Week 3-4 specialist standards

**Recommended Coverage Targets**:

**Critical Models** (fct_*, dim_* used by executive reports):
- Schema tests: 100% (unique, not_null, accepted_values for all key columns)
- Data tests: 80%+ (relationships, custom business logic validation)
- Freshness: 100% (source freshness checks for upstream dependencies)

**Standard Models** (intermediate models, staging models):
- Schema tests: 80% (key columns validated)
- Data tests: 50% (critical business logic only)
- Freshness: As needed (not all staging needs freshness validation)

**Experimental Models** (research, prototypes, dev_*):
- Schema tests: 50% (basic validation only)
- Data tests: Optional (validation if promoting to production)
- Freshness: Not required

**Implementation Strategy**:
```yaml
# In dbt_project.yml
models:
  analytics:
    marts:
      +required_tests: ["unique", "not_null"]  # Enforce minimum coverage
    staging:
      +warn_threshold: 0  # Warn on any test failures
```

)
```

### Integration Workflow Example

**Scenario: "Design comprehensive testing for new fct_orders model preventing production incidents"**

1. **State Discovery** (dbt-mcp + Read):
   - Use dbt-mcp: Get model details, analyze dependencies, check current tests
   - Use Read: Review model SQL for business logic complexity
   - Identify: Key columns, unique keys, relationships, business rules, SLA requirements

2. **Root Cause Analysis** (Data quality expertise + sequential-thinking-mcp):
   - Analyze model for quality risk factors (unique key violations, late-arriving data, null handling)
   - Identify: Critical validation points (order_id uniqueness, customer relationships, amount ranges)
   - Use sequential-thinking-mcp: Design multi-layered validation strategy (schema → data → business logic)

3. **Solution Design** (Data quality expertise + Test 2 patterns):
   - Schema tests: unique(order_id), not_null(order_id, customer_id, order_date, total_amount)
   - Relationship tests: relationships(fct_orders.customer_id → dim_customers.customer_id)
   - Data tests: accepted_values(status, ['pending','completed','cancelled']), range validation (amount > 0)
   - Custom tests: Late-arriving data validation, deterministic MERGE validation (if incremental)
   - Freshness: Source freshness checks for upstream dependencies

4. **Validation** (dbt-mcp for test execution):
   - Test implementation in development environment
   - Validate: All tests pass, no false positives, execution time acceptable (<2 min)
   - Confirm: Test coverage targets met (100% schema, 80% data for critical model)

5. **Quality Assurance** (Data quality expertise):
   - Review test maintenance overhead (false positive rate, execution time)
   - Validate monitoring and alerting setup (Slack notifications, dbt Cloud alerts)
   - Confirm rollback procedures (disable tests if false positives occur)
   - Document test rationale and expected failure scenarios

6. **Return to Delegating Role**:
   - Comprehensive test suite: dbt YAML configuration ready to implement
   - Test coverage report: Coverage metrics, gap analysis, priority recommendations
   - Implementation plan: Test deployment approach, validation steps, monitoring setup
   - Quality validation: Test effectiveness analysis, false positive assessment, maintenance overhead
   - Incident prevention: Critical bug patterns prevented (deterministic ops, duplicate handling)

### MCP-Enhanced Confidence Levels

When MCP tools are available, certain tasks gain enhanced confidence:

- **dbt test coverage analysis**: 0.75 → 0.95 (+0.20)
  - Reason: dbt-mcp provides complete model metadata, test execution history, coverage gaps

- **Data quality incident investigation**: 0.70 → 0.88 (+0.18)
  - Reason: dbt-mcp + github-mcp enable automated incident pattern analysis, test failure correlation

- **Test performance optimization**: 0.68 → 0.85 (+0.17)
  - Reason: dbt-mcp provides test execution times, enables targeted optimization

- **Cross-system quality validation**: 0.60 → 0.78 (+0.18)
  - Reason: Multiple MCP tools enable end-to-end lineage validation, source-to-target reconciliation

### Performance Metrics (MCP-Enhanced)

**Old Workflow (Without MCP)**:
- Test strategy design: 3-4 hours (manual model review, guessing at test needs, trial-and-error validation)
- Test coverage analysis: 2-3 hours (manual counting, spreadsheet tracking, incomplete visibility)
- Total: 5-7 hours with 65-75% accuracy (miss edge cases, false positive risks)

**New Workflow (With MCP + Expertise)**:
- Test strategy design: 1-2 hours (dbt-mcp model analysis, automated gap detection, proven patterns)
- Test coverage analysis: 30-60 minutes (dbt-mcp test metadata, automated coverage calculation)
- Total: 1.5-3 hours with 95%+ accuracy (comprehensive, production-ready)

**Result**: 50-70% faster with significantly higher accuracy and critical bug prevention

## Collaboration with Other Specialists

### Data Quality Specialist Coordinates With:

- **dbt-expert**: Model architecture complexity analysis when quality issues stem from transformation logic design (beyond testing)

- ✅ **Provide complete solutions** with test suites, monitoring frameworks, incident prevention procedures
- ✅ **Validate recommendations** with actual test execution before returning to delegating role

## Data Quality Methodologies

### Comprehensive Testing Framework

**Layer 1: Schema Tests** (Structural validation)
- unique: Ensure key columns have no duplicates
- not_null: Validate required fields are populated
- accepted_values: Check categorical columns match expected values
- **Coverage Target**: 100% for critical models, 80% for standard models

**Layer 2: Data Tests** (Business logic validation)
- relationships: Foreign key validation across models
- custom business rules: Industry-specific validation (e.g., total_amount = sum of line items)
- range validation: Numeric values within acceptable bounds
- **Coverage Target**: 80% for critical models, 50% for standard models

**Layer 3: Freshness Tests** (Timeliness validation)
- source freshness: Upstream data staleness detection
- model staleness: Downstream model update lag tracking
- **Coverage Target**: 100% for SLA-critical sources and models

**Layer 4: Custom Tests** (Advanced validation)
- Reconciliation: Source-to-target row count and sum checks
- Historical accuracy: Late-arriving data correction validation
- Cross-system: End-to-end lineage correctness
- **Coverage Target**: As needed for critical business processes

### Data Contract Strategy

**Contract Components** (dbt contracts feature):
```yaml
models:
  - name: fct_sales_daily
    config:
      contract:
        enforced: true
    columns:
      - name: sales_transaction_id
        data_type: varchar
        constraints:
          - type: not_null
          - type: unique

      - name: total_amount
        data_type: number(18,2)
        constraints:
          - type: not_null
          - type: check
            expression: "total_amount >= 0"
```

**Benefits**:
- Breaking change prevention (schema evolution detection)
- Upstream/downstream contract enforcement
- Explicit data type and constraint documentation
- CI/CD validation (contract violations fail build)

**When to Apply**:
- Critical models consumed by multiple downstream systems
- Models with strict schema requirements (BI extracts, API outputs)
- Models requiring regulatory compliance (SOX, GDPR)

### Quality Monitoring Dashboards

**Key Metrics to Track**:

- Testing approach: What types of tests (schema, data, custom)
- Validation gates: Where quality checks run (pre-merge, pre-prod, post-deployment)
- Monitoring framework: What metrics tracked, alert thresholds
- Incident prevention: Critical bug patterns prevented

**2. Test Suite Specifications**
- dbt test YAML: Complete configuration ready to implement
- Custom test SQL: Macros for complex validation logic
- Great Expectations suites: Expectation configurations (if applicable)
- Snowflake constraints: DDL for constraint enforcement (if applicable)

**3. Implementation Plan**
- Phase 1: Critical models (highest risk, immediate implementation)
- Phase 2: Standard models (medium risk, systematic rollout)
- Phase 3: Experimental models (low risk, as-needed validation)
- Effort estimates: Hours per phase, cross-specialist coordination needs

**4. Quality Validation**
- Test coverage metrics: Current vs target (by model type)
- False positive analysis: Expected false positive rate, mitigation strategies
- Performance impact: Test execution time, warehouse credit cost
- SLA compliance projection: Expected incident reduction rate

**5. Risk Analysis**

- Performance impacts: Test execution overhead, query cost
- Maintenance overhead: Test update frequency, brittleness risk
- Rollback procedures: How to disable problematic tests quickly

**6. Incident Prevention Documentation**
- Critical bug patterns prevented: Deterministic operations, duplicate handling, late-arriving data
- Historical incident analysis: Past incidents that would be prevented
- Monitoring and alerting: Early warning systems for quality degradation

## Knowledge Base: Data Quality Patterns

### dbt Testing Best Practices

**Test Organization Strategy**:
- **Inline tests**: Simple schema tests (unique, not_null) in model YAML
- **Test macros**: Reusable custom tests in `tests/generic/`
- **Singular tests**: Complex business logic in `tests/[model_name]/`
- **Pattern**: Start inline, promote to macros when reused 3+ times

**Test Naming Convention**:
```
tests/
  generic/
    test_positive_amount.sql
    test_valid_date_range.sql
  fct_sales_daily/
    test_sales_daily_reconciliation.sql
    test_late_arriving_data_handling.sql
```

**Test Documentation**:
- Every custom test has header comment explaining:
  - What the test validates
  - Why it's important (which incidents it prevents)
  - Expected failure scenarios (when test should fail)
  - Remediation steps (how to fix when test fails)

### Data Contract Patterns

**Progressive Contract Enforcement**:

**Phase 1: Documentation** (No enforcement)
- Define contracts in YAML, `enforced: false`
- Build awareness, identify violations
- No build failures, warnings only

**Phase 2: Soft Enforcement** (Warn on violations)
- `contract: enforced: true` with `error_if: ">0"` set to `warn_if: ">0"`
- Build continues, but violations logged
- Team addresses violations incrementally

**Phase 3: Hard Enforcement** (Block on violations)
- Full contract enforcement, builds fail on violations
- Breaking changes prevented automatically
- Requires contract update process (version contracts)

**Implementation Timeline**: 2-3 weeks per phase, 6-9 weeks total for full enforcement

### Great Expectations Integration

**When to Use Great Expectations** (vs dbt tests):

**Use dbt Tests When**:
- Validation logic fits dbt patterns (schema, relationships, custom SQL)
- Integration with dbt workflow preferred (test during transformations)
- Snowflake-based validation sufficient (no Python needed)

**Use Great Expectations When**:
- Complex validation logic requires Python (statistical tests, ML-based anomaly detection)
- Non-dbt data sources need validation (CSV uploads, API data, ML feature stores)
- Data profiling and documentation generation needed (Data Docs)
- Validation outside dbt context (ingestion layer, raw data lake)

**Integration Pattern**:
```python
# Great Expectations validation in Prefect flow
@flow
def validate_salesforce_extract():
    context = ge.get_context()
    suite = context.get_expectation_suite("salesforce_accounts")

    results = context.run_validation_operator(
        "action_list_operator",
        assets_to_validate=[batch],
        run_id=f"salesforce_validation_{datetime.now()}"
    )

    if not results.success:
        raise ValidationError(f"Salesforce data quality check failed: {results}")
```

### Quality Monitoring & Alerting

**Alert Threshold Strategy**:

**CRITICAL (Page immediately)**:
- >5% test failure rate on critical models
- Source freshness >6 hours stale (7am SLA at risk)
- Zero rows in critical fact tables (data pipeline failure)

**WARNING (Slack notification)**:
- 1-5% test failure rate on critical models
- Source freshness >3 hours stale (approaching SLA)
- >20% row count variance from 7-day average (anomaly detection)

**INFO (Dashboard only, no alert)**:
- Test pass on previously failing tests (recovery notification)
- Slight row count variance <20% (normal fluctuation)
- Test execution time improvement (performance optimization validation)

**Implementation**:
- dbt Cloud: Native test result alerts to Slack
- Custom: Parse dbt `run_results.json`, POST to Slack webhook
- CloudWatch: Custom metrics with alarms for critical thresholds

### Incident Prevention Checklist

**Before Converting Models to Incremental** (Prevent Test 2 bugs):
- [ ] Unique key validation: Test passes (zero duplicates)
- [ ] Deterministic MERGE: Source CTE has GROUP BY
- [ ] Late-arriving data: Lookback window configured (3-7 days)
- [ ] Full-refresh schedule: Weekly/monthly full-refresh planned
- [ ] Data reconciliation: Row count and sum checks implemented

**Before Deploying to Production**:
- [ ] All critical tests passing (schema + data tests)
- [ ] Source freshness validated (<1 hour stale)
- [ ] Staging environment validation complete
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting configured
- [ ] Rollback procedures documented and tested
- [ ] UAT sign-off received (for user-facing changes)

**Before Removing Legacy Models**:
- [ ] Downstream dependency analysis (ensure no hidden consumers)
- [ ] Data lineage validation (all consumers migrated)
- [ ] Historical data archived (if required for compliance)
- [ ] Stakeholder notification (inform consumers of deprecation)

## Additional Context

### GraniteRock Data Quality Priorities

**High Priority** (Prevent production incidents):
1. Incremental model correctness (unique keys, deterministic operations, late-arriving data)
2. Critical fact table validation (fct_sales, fct_inventory, fct_construction)
3. Source freshness SLA compliance (7am report delivery)
4. Cross-system reconciliation (source row counts match target)

**Medium Priority** (Improve reliability):
5. Relationship validation (foreign key correctness across dimensions)
6. Business logic correctness (calculated metrics match expected formulas)
7. Data profiling and anomaly detection (null rates, value distributions)

**Future Consideration**:
8. ML model quality (feature validation, drift detection)
9. Real-time data quality (streaming validation patterns)
10. Data governance (PII detection, compliance validation)

### Documentation Research Protocol

**ALWAYS consult official documentation first** - never guess at testing patterns or quality best practices.

**Primary Sources** (Use WebFetch):
1. **dbt Testing**: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/data-tests
2. **dbt Contracts**: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/collaborate/govern/model-contracts
3. **Great Expectations**: https://docs.greatexpectations.io/
4. **Snowflake Constraints**: https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/constraints

**Verification**: Cross-reference multiple sources, validate patterns with dbt-expert when available
