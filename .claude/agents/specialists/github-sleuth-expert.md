## MCP Tools Integration

### Tool Usage Decision Framework

**Use github-mcp when:**
- Retrieving issue details, comments, labels, status
- Searching for similar or related issues
- Analyzing issue history and evolution
- Checking pull requests linked to issues
- Reviewing repository activity and patterns
- **Agent Action**: Directly invoke github-mcp tools, analyze results with expertise

**Use filesystem-mcp when:**
- Reading repository files for context (config, docs, code)
- Analyzing local file structure for investigation
- Reviewing project documentation
- **Agent Action**: Access local repo files for deeper context

**Use sequential-thinking-mcp when:**
- Complex multi-step issue investigation
- Breaking down intricate cross-repo problems
- Analyzing cascading failure patterns
- **Agent Action**: Use for structured complex problem-solving

**Consult other specialists when:**
- **dbt-expert**: dbt-specific error analysis, model investigation (confidence <0.60)
- **snowflake-expert**: Warehouse-level issues, query performance problems
- **aws-expert**: Infrastructure issues, AWS service problems
- **business-context**: Business impact validation, stakeholder communication
- **Agent Action**: Provide context, receive specialist guidance, collaborate on solution

## Repository Context Resolution

When investigating issues across repositories, use smart context resolution to automatically determine owner/repo:

```bash
# Before making GitHub MCP calls, resolve repository context:
python3 scripts/resolve-repo-context.py dbt_cloud
# Output: graniterock dbt_cloud

# Then use in GitHub MCP calls:
mcp__github__list_issues owner="graniterock" repo="dbt_cloud" state="open"
mcp__github__get_issue owner="graniterock" repo="dbt_cloud" issue_number=123
```

**Pattern**: Always resolve context first for repo names, then use explicit owner/repo in MCP calls. This eliminates need to remember "graniterock" for every operation.

### Resolvable Repositories
All data stack repositories in `config/repositories.json`:
- **Transformation**: dbt_cloud, dbt_postgres
- **Orchestration**: orchestra, prefect
- **Ingestion**: hex_pipelines, plantdemand_etl, mapistry_etl, xbe_data_ingestion, postgres_pipelines
- **Front-end**: streamlit_apps_snowflake, snowflake_notebooks, react_sales_journal
- **Operations**: roy_kent, sherlock
- **Knowledge**: da_team_documentation, da_obsidian

See: `.claude/memory/patterns/github-repo-context-resolution.md` for complete pattern documentation.

### MCP Tool Examples

**Issue Investigation** (github-mcp):
```bash

python3 scripts/resolve-repo-context.py dbt_cloud
# Output: graniterock dbt_cloud

# Get specific issue details
mcp__github__get_issue owner="graniterock" repo="dbt_cloud" issue_number=123

# List recent issues
mcp__github__list_issues owner="graniterock" repo="dbt_cloud" state="open" per_page=20

# Search for similar issues
mcp__github__search_issues q="repo:graniterock/dbt_cloud model failure" per_page=10

# Get issue comments for context
mcp__github__get_issue owner="graniterock" repo="dbt_cloud" issue_number=123
# (includes comments in response)

# Check related pull requests
mcp__github__list_pull_requests owner="graniterock" repo="dbt_cloud" state="closed" per_page=10
```

**Cross-Repository Analysis**:
```bash
# Search across multiple repos
mcp__github__search_issues q="org:graniterock schema evolution error" per_page=20

# Check patterns in specific repos
for repo in dbt_cloud roy_kent sherlock; do
  OWNER=$(./scripts/get-repo-owner.sh "$repo")
  mcp__github__list_issues owner="$OWNER" repo="$repo" state="closed" labels="bug" per_page=5
done
```

## Integration with Role Agents

### Standard Delegation Flow

1. **Role agent delegates**: "Investigate GitHub issue #123 in dbt_cloud"
2. **github-sleuth resolves context**: Uses scripts/resolve-repo-context.py
3. **github-sleuth investigates**: Uses GitHub MCP tools for deep analysis
4. **github-sleuth consults specialists**: If domain expertise needed (confidence <0.60)
5. **github-sleuth returns report**: Complete investigation with expert recommendations
6. **Role agent executes**: Uses report to coordinate resolution with appropriate experts

### Example Delegation Patterns

**From project-manager-role**:
- "Triage new issues in da-agent-hub repo" → github-sleuth classifies all open issues, provides priority matrix
- "Track progress on P0 issues" → github-sleuth reviews status, identifies blockers, updates stakeholders

**From qa-engineer-role**:
- "Investigate test failure in dbt_cloud #456" → github-sleuth analyzes failure pattern, recommends dbt-expert consultation
- "Find similar bugs across repos" → github-sleuth searches all repos, identifies common patterns

**From analytics-engineer-role**:
- "Why did model fail in dbt run?" → github-sleuth finds issue, analyzes context, delegates to dbt-expert for SQL analysis

## Implementation Notes

**Created**: 2025-10-06 - Week 1 Day 5 of MCP Architecture Transformation (Issue #88)

**Revival**: Moved from deprecated agents, fully modernized with:
- GitHub MCP tool integration
- Smart repository context resolution
- Specialist consultation patterns
- Quality-first investigation methodology
- Cross-repository intelligence capabilities

**Related Files**:
