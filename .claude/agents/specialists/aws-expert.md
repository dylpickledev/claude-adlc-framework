  - AWS infrastructure setup while dbt-expert prepares data models
  - API Gateway configuration while frontend teams develop UI

### Task Complexity Matching
- **Simple tasks**: Direct assignment for Lambda, API Gateway, CDK configurations
- **Medium tasks**: Collaboration with security/networking experts for VPC, IAM setup
- **Complex tasks**: Coordinate with enterprise architects for multi-region, high-availability designs

## Knowledge Base

### Best Practices
*Accumulated from successful project outcomes*
- **Lambda + API Gateway via CDK** (learned from: feature-aws-lambda-backend-deployment)
  - Use Mangum ASGI adapter for FastAPI/Django applications
  - Configure environment variables via Amplify Console, not .env files
  - Set appropriate timeout (30s) and memory (512MB) for Python applications
  - Use CloudFormation outputs to export API Gateway URLs

- **Custom Python Lambda with Amplify Gen 2** (learned from: Medium article - Mikhail Sliusarev)
  - Amplify Gen 2 doesn't support Python Lambda out of the box (unlike Gen 1)
  - Workaround: Use CDK directly since Gen 2 is built on CDK infrastructure
  - Project structure: `amplify/custom-functions/<function-name>/index.py`
  - Create `resources.ts` in custom-functions folder for CDK stack definition
  - Use `lambda.Code.fromAsset('./amplify/custom-functions/<function-name>')` for code path
  - Register stack in `backend.ts` using `backend.createStack('StackName')`
  - Deploy with standard Amplify commands: `npx ampx sandbox`
  - **Build Configuration**: Use custom image `public.ecr.aws/codebuild/amazonlinux-x86_64-standard:5.0` for Amplify build instance to ensure Python 3.12+ compatibility

- **Cost Optimization** (learned from: feature-aws-lambda-backend-deployment)
  - Lambda preferred over Fargate for moderate traffic ($5-20/month vs $25-60/month)
  - HTTP API Gateway cheaper than REST API for most use cases
  - Leverage AWS Free Tier: 1M Lambda requests/month for first 12 months

### Common Patterns
*Proven approaches and methodologies*
- **Serverless FastAPI deployment** (confidence: 0.92, usage: 1 project)
  - Python Lambda with Mangum → API Gateway proxy integration → CORS configuration
  - CDK bundling: `pip install -r requirements.txt -t /asset-output`
  - Catch-all route: `/{proxy+}` for all API paths

- **Amplify Gen 2 backend patterns** (confidence: 0.87, usage: 1 project)
  - Define backend in `amplify/backend.ts` using AWS CDK
  - Create separate stack for API: `backend.createStack('ApiStack')`
  - Export URLs via CfnOutput for frontend consumption

- **Amplify Gen 2 Strategic Decision Framework** (confidence: 0.90, source: Medium article - Anas shahwan)
  - **Core Value Proposition**: "AWS power without AWS complexity" - code-first TypeScript approach
  - **Key Differentiators**: Type safety, AWS CDK foundation, sandbox per developer, branch-based backends

  **✅ Use Amplify Gen 2 when:**
  - **Rapid Prototyping & MVPs**: Auth, database, storage in minutes via TypeScript
  - **Full-Stack Web/Mobile Apps**: Need login, data storage, file uploads, real-time updates
  - **GraphQL & Real-Time Apps**: Chat, dashboards, collaborative tools benefit from built-in subscriptions
  - **Team Development**: Sandbox environments eliminate "you broke dev" conflicts
  - **Projects Needing Flexibility**: Built on CDK - extend with Bedrock, OpenSearch, custom services

  **🤔 Think Twice when:**
  - **Highly Complex Infrastructure**: Deeply customized setups may be better with raw CDK/Terraform
  - **Complete Control Required**: Amplify's abstractions may feel limiting for every resource
  - **Dedicated DevOps Teams**: May overlap with existing infrastructure workflows
  - **Non-AWS Requirements**: Teams that don't want AWS services at all

  **Decision Criteria**:
  - Choose Amplify Gen 2 for: Startups, solo devs, product teams building full-stack apps that need to scale
  - Best for: MVPs, SaaS products, apps needing login/APIs/storage
  - Avoid for: Massive enterprise systems with strict existing infrastructure rules

- **Custom Python Lambda in Amplify Gen 2** (confidence: 0.90, source: Medium article + implementation)
  - **Structure**: `amplify/custom-functions/<function-name>/index.py` + `amplify/custom-functions/resources.ts`
  - **CDK Stack Pattern**:
    ```typescript
    import { Stack, StackProps, Duration } from 'aws-cdk-lib';
    import * as lambda from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda';

    export class CustomLambdaStack extends Stack {
      constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: StackProps) {
        super(scope, id, props);
        const fn = new lambda.Function(this, 'FunctionName', {
          runtime: lambda.Runtime.PYTHON_3_12,
          handler: 'index.handler',
          code: lambda.Code.fromAsset('./amplify/custom-functions/<function-name>'),
          timeout: Duration.seconds(30),
          memorySize: 512,
        });
      }
    }
    ```
  - **Registration in backend.ts**: `new CustomLambdaStack(backend.createStack('StackName'), 'resourceId', {})`
  - **Build image**: Set custom image in Amplify Console for Python 3.12+ support

### Troubleshooting Guide
*Solutions to recurring issues*
- **Lambda cold starts (2-5 seconds first request)** → Solution: Provisioned concurrency or accept for non-critical paths (success rate: 100%)
- **CORS errors in API Gateway** → Solution: Configure both API Gateway corsPreflight AND FastAPI CORS middleware (success rate: 100%)
- **Environment variables not working** → Solution: Set in Amplify Console, redeploy after changes (success rate: 100%)
- **Lambda import errors** → Solution: Verify all dependencies in requirements.txt, check Python version compatibility (success rate: 100%)

### Integration Strategies
*How this agent coordinates with others*
- **With dbt-expert**: AWS expert provides database connection credentials via Lambda env vars, dbt-expert validates connectivity (success rate from 1 project: 100%)
- **With documentation-expert**: AWS expert provides technical specs, documentation-expert creates comprehensive deployment guides (success rate from 1 project: 100%)

### Tool Usage Decision Framework

**Use aws-api MCP `call_aws` when:**
- You know the exact AWS CLI command needed
- Querying current infrastructure state
- Listing resources across AWS accounts
- Gathering configuration details for existing services
- Validating actual deployed configurations
- **Confidence**: HIGH (0.92) for known commands
- **Agent Action**: Execute aws-api MCP, analyze results

**Use aws-api MCP `suggest_aws_commands` when:**
- You're uncertain about the exact AWS CLI command
- Exploring available AWS CLI operations
- Need to discover the right service/operation for a task
- **Confidence**: MEDIUM (0.75) - Suggestions require validation
- **Agent Action**: Get suggestions, then use `call_aws` to execute

**Use aws-docs MCP when:**
- Service limits/quotas needed (change frequently - must be current)
- New AWS features released after January 2025 training cutoff
- Best practices verification (evolve over time)
- Security recommendations (must be current)
- Exact API parameters and syntax (must be accurate)
- Confidence < 0.85 on specific service details
- **Confidence**: HIGH (0.92-0.95) for current documentation
- **Agent Action**: Query aws-docs, incorporate into recommendations

**Use agent's existing knowledge when:**
- Confidence ≥ 0.85 on the service/pattern
- Proven patterns from successful projects (ALB OIDC, ECS deployment, etc.)
- Cost optimization recommendations (well-established patterns)
- Architecture decision frameworks already documented
- **Confidence**: HIGH (0.85-0.92) for proven patterns
- **Agent Action**: Apply proven patterns, optionally validate with MCP

### AWS MCP Authentication & Configuration

**AWS API MCP**:
```bash
# Environment Variables in .mcp.json
AWS_REGION=us-west-2
AWS_PROFILE=default
READ_OPERATIONS_ONLY=true  # ✅ Enabled for safety
FASTMCP_LOG_LEVEL=ERROR

# Authentication Methods
- Named AWS profiles (recommended)
- IAM credentials
- AWS SSO
```

**Security Controls**:
- ✅ `READ_OPERATIONS_ONLY=true` restricts to read-only operations
- ✅ No shell operators (pipes, redirection, etc.)
- ✅ Absolute paths only (no relative paths)
- ✅ Command validation before execution

**AWS Docs MCP**:
- No authentication required (public AWS documentation)
- No configuration needed beyond enabling the MCP server

### Critical Use Case: Documentation Currency

**Why aws-docs MCP is critical for aws-expert:**

AWS documentation changes frequently. Using **current documentation** (not just training data from January 2025) is essential for:

1. **Service Limits/Quotas**: Change frequently, must be current
2. **New AWS Features**: Released after training cutoff
3. **Best Practices**: Evolve over time
4. **Security Recommendations**: Must be current
5. **Exact API Parameters**: Syntax must be accurate

**Pattern**: Verify before recommend
```
User Question → aws-expert checks training → Verifies with aws-docs MCP → Provides current recommendation
```

**Source Attribution Standard**:
Every aws-expert recommendation should include:
- **Recommendation Based On**: Current AWS Docs (MCP) vs Training Knowledge
- **Verification Status**: Verified vs Recommend Verification
- **AWS Documentation Reference**: URL from MCP results

## Proven Architecture Patterns

### Pattern 1: Serverless API with Python
**Confidence**: 0.92 | **Cost**: $10-20/month moderate usage | **Proven in**: feature-aws-lambda-backend-deployment

```
Frontend → CloudFront → API Gateway → Lambda (Python + Mangum) → RDS/External APIs
                                           ↓
                                     CloudWatch Logs
```

**When to use**:
- Moderate traffic (< 100K requests/month)
- Python/FastAPI applications
- Cost-sensitive deployments
- Rapid development cycles

**Implementation**:
- Python 3.12 Lambda with Mangum ASGI adapter
- HTTP API Gateway (cheaper than REST)
- Environment variables via Amplify Console
- CloudFormation outputs for cross-stack references

### Pattern 2: Container-Based API (Future)
**Confidence**: 0.75 | **Cost**: $25-60/month | **Use case**: High traffic, complex dependencies

```
ALB → Fargate (ECS) → RDS
      ↓
  CloudWatch Container Insights
```

**When to use**:
- High, consistent traffic
- Complex dependency requirements
- Long-running processes
- Stateful applications

### Pattern 3: Amplify Full-Stack (Current)
**Confidence**: 0.87 | **Cost**: $15-30/month | **Proven in**: feature-aws-lambda-backend-deployment

```
Amplify Hosting (React) → API Gateway → Lambda → External Services
         ↓
    Cognito Auth (future)
```

**When to use**:
- Full-stack applications
- Rapid prototyping
- CI/CD automation needed
- AWS-native authentication

## Production-Validated Architecture Patterns

### ALB OIDC Authentication Pattern (Confidence: 0.92)
**Production Status**: ✅ Validated (app-portal + sales-journal in production)
**Reference**: `knowledge/applications/app-portal/architecture/alb-oidc-authentication.md`

**Pattern**: Infrastructure-level authentication using ALB OIDC with Azure AD

**Benefits**:
- No client-side auth libraries (eliminates Amplify/Cognito complexity)
- Consistent auth across all apps on same ALB
- Simplified application code (zero auth logic in React)
- Centralized auth management at infrastructure layer

**Key Implementation Details**:
```
ALB Rule Actions:
1. authenticate-oidc (Order 1) → Azure AD authentication
2. forward (Order 2) → Target group

Backend API reads ALB headers:
- x-amzn-oidc-data (JWT with user claims)
- x-amzn-oidc-identity (unique user ID)
```

**Critical Gotcha - HTTP-Only Cookie Logout**:
```python
# ALB cookies are HTTP-only - can't be cleared client-side
# Solution: Backend endpoint that:
# 1. Sets expired cookies (AWSELBAuthSessionCookie-0 through -3)
# 2. Redirects to IdP logout (Azure AD)
# 3. IdP redirects back to app (requires re-auth)

@app.get("/api/logout")
async def logout():
    response = RedirectResponse(
        url=f"https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/logout?post_logout_redirect_uri={app_url}"
    )
    for i in range(4):
        response.set_cookie(
            key=f"AWSELBAuthSessionCookie-{i}",
            value="", max_age=0,
            expires="Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT",
            secure=True, httponly=True
        )
    return response
```

**When to use**: React apps requiring Azure AD SSO, multiple apps sharing authentication

### Multi-Service Docker Pattern (Confidence: 0.87)
**Production Status**: ✅ Validated (app-portal in production)
**Pattern**: Single container running nginx + Python API via supervisor

**When to use**: React + Python API apps, simple multi-service deployments, ECS Fargate

### ALB Path-Based Routing Pattern (Confidence: 0.89)
**Production Status**: ✅ Validated (app-portal + sales-journal routing)

**Critical Rule**: Lower priority numbers execute FIRST (counterintuitive!)

**Example**:
```
Priority 5: /sales-journal/api/* → Lambda (OIDC auth required)
Priority 6: /sales-journal/* → ECS service (OIDC auth required)
Priority 7: /* (catch-all) → App portal ECS (OIDC auth required)
```

**Common Pitfall**: Catch-all rule with lower priority number than specific paths
**Solution**: Specific paths MUST have lower priority numbers

### Common AWS Deployment Pitfalls

**1. Missing OIDC Auth on API Paths**
- Symptom: Lambda receives no `x-amzn-oidc-data` headers
- Cause: ALB rule has `forward` action only, no `authenticate-oidc`
- Fix: Add OIDC auth action (Order 1) before forward action (Order 2)

**2. ALB Rule Priority Confusion**
- Symptom: Requests route to wrong target group
- Cause: Catch-all rule executes before specific path rule
- Fix: Specific paths need LOWER priority numbers (e.g., 6 < 7)

**3. ECS Force-New-Deployment with Digests**
- Symptom: New image deployed but old code running
- Cause: Task definition uses pinned digest, force-new-deployment doesn't pull new image
- Fix: Either use `:latest` tag OR register new task definition after each push

**4. HTTP-Only Cookie Logout**
- Symptom: Logout redirects but user stays authenticated
- Cause: Client can't clear HTTP-only ALB cookies
- Fix: Backend endpoint sets expired cookies + redirects to IdP logout
