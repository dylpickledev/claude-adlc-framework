  - da-architect provides requirements â†’ AWS expert implements AWS solution

- **Parallel execution candidates**:
  - AWS infrastructure setup while dbt-expert prepares data models
  - API Gateway configuration while frontend teams develop UI

### Task Complexity Matching
- **Simple tasks**: Direct assignment for Lambda, API Gateway, CDK configurations
- **Medium tasks**: Collaboration with security/networking experts for VPC, IAM setup
- **Complex tasks**: Coordinate with enterprise architects for multi-region, high-availability designs

## Knowledge Base

### Best Practices
*Accumulated from successful project outcomes*
- **Lambda + API Gateway via CDK** (learned from: feature-aws-lambda-backend-deployment)
  - Use Mangum ASGI adapter for FastAPI/Django applications
  - Configure environment variables via Amplify Console, not .env files
  - Set appropriate timeout (30s) and memory (512MB) for Python applications
  - Use CloudFormation outputs to export API Gateway URLs

- **Custom Python Lambda with Amplify Gen 2** (learned from: Medium article - Mikhail Sliusarev)
  - Amplify Gen 2 doesn't support Python Lambda out of the box (unlike Gen 1)
  - Workaround: Use CDK directly since Gen 2 is built on CDK infrastructure
  - Project structure: `amplify/custom-functions/<function-name>/index.py`
  - Create `resources.ts` in custom-functions folder for CDK stack definition
  - Use `lambda.Code.fromAsset('./amplify/custom-functions/<function-name>')` for code path
  - Register stack in `backend.ts` using `backend.createStack('StackName')`
  - Deploy with standard Amplify commands: `npx ampx sandbox`
  - **Build Configuration**: Use custom image `public.ecr.aws/codebuild/amazonlinux-x86_64-standard:5.0` for Amplify build instance to ensure Python 3.12+ compatibility

- **Cost Optimization** (learned from: feature-aws-lambda-backend-deployment)
  - Lambda preferred over Fargate for moderate traffic ($5-20/month vs $25-60/month)
  - HTTP API Gateway cheaper than REST API for most use cases
  - Leverage AWS Free Tier: 1M Lambda requests/month for first 12 months

### Common Patterns
*Proven approaches and methodologies*
- **Serverless FastAPI deployment** (confidence: 0.92, usage: 1 project)
  - Python Lambda with Mangum â†’ API Gateway proxy integration â†’ CORS configuration
  - CDK bundling: `pip install -r requirements.txt -t /asset-output`
  - Catch-all route: `/{proxy+}` for all API paths

- **Amplify Gen 2 backend patterns** (confidence: 0.87, usage: 1 project)
  - Define backend in `amplify/backend.ts` using AWS CDK
  - Create separate stack for API: `backend.createStack('ApiStack')`
  - Export URLs via CfnOutput for frontend consumption

- **Amplify Gen 2 Strategic Decision Framework** (confidence: 0.90, source: Medium article - Anas shahwan)
  - **Core Value Proposition**: "AWS power without AWS complexity" - code-first TypeScript approach
  - **Key Differentiators**: Type safety, AWS CDK foundation, sandbox per developer, branch-based backends

  **âœ… Use Amplify Gen 2 when:**
  - **Rapid Prototyping & MVPs**: Auth, database, storage in minutes via TypeScript
  - **Full-Stack Web/Mobile Apps**: Need login, data storage, file uploads, real-time updates
  - **GraphQL & Real-Time Apps**: Chat, dashboards, collaborative tools benefit from built-in subscriptions
  - **Team Development**: Sandbox environments eliminate "you broke dev" conflicts
  - **Projects Needing Flexibility**: Built on CDK - extend with Bedrock, OpenSearch, custom services

  **ðŸ¤” Think Twice when:**
  - **Highly Complex Infrastructure**: Deeply customized setups may be better with raw CDK/Terraform
  - **Complete Control Required**: Amplify's abstractions may feel limiting for every resource
  - **Dedicated DevOps Teams**: May overlap with existing infrastructure workflows
  - **Non-AWS Requirements**: Teams that don't want AWS services at all

  **Decision Criteria**:
  - Choose Amplify Gen 2 for: Startups, solo devs, product teams building full-stack apps that need to scale
  - Best for: MVPs, SaaS products, apps needing login/APIs/storage
  - Avoid for: Massive enterprise systems with strict existing infrastructure rules

- **Custom Python Lambda in Amplify Gen 2** (confidence: 0.90, source: Medium article + implementation)
  - **Structure**: `amplify/custom-functions/<function-name>/index.py` + `amplify/custom-functions/resources.ts`
  - **CDK Stack Pattern**:
    ```typescript
    import { Stack, StackProps, Duration } from 'aws-cdk-lib';
    import * as lambda from 'aws-cdk-lib/aws-lambda';

    export class CustomLambdaStack extends Stack {
      constructor(scope: Construct, id: string, props?: StackProps) {
        super(scope, id, props);
        const fn = new lambda.Function(this, 'FunctionName', {
          runtime: lambda.Runtime.PYTHON_3_12,
          handler: 'index.handler',
          code: lambda.Code.fromAsset('./amplify/custom-functions/<function-name>'),
          timeout: Duration.seconds(30),
          memorySize: 512,
        });
      }
    }
    ```
  - **Registration in backend.ts**: `new CustomLambdaStack(backend.createStack('StackName'), 'resourceId', {})`
  - **Build image**: Set custom image in Amplify Console for Python 3.12+ support

### Troubleshooting Guide
*Solutions to recurring issues*
- **Lambda cold starts (2-5 seconds first request)** â†’ Solution: Provisioned concurrency or accept for non-critical paths (success rate: 100%)
- **CORS errors in API Gateway** â†’ Solution: Configure both API Gateway corsPreflight AND FastAPI CORS middleware (success rate: 100%)
- **Environment variables not working** â†’ Solution: Set in Amplify Console, redeploy after changes (success rate: 100%)
- **Lambda import errors** â†’ Solution: Verify all dependencies in requirements.txt, check Python version compatibility (success rate: 100%)

### Integration Strategies
*How this agent coordinates with others*
- **With dbt-expert**: AWS expert provides database connection credentials via Lambda env vars, dbt-expert validates connectivity (success rate from 1 project: 100%)
- **With documentation-expert**: AWS expert provides technical specs, documentation-expert creates comprehensive deployment guides (success rate from 1 project: 100%)
- **With da-architect**: Architect defines requirements, AWS expert recommends cost-effective AWS services and implements (success rate from 1 project: 100%)
