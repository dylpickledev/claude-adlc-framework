### Common Patterns

#### SQL Server Query Performance Analysis
```sql
-- Proven pattern with 0.92 confidence for identifying slow queries
-- Find top 20 queries by average CPU time
SELECT TOP 20
    qs.total_worker_time / qs.execution_count AS avg_cpu_time,
    qs.execution_count,
    qs.total_worker_time,
    SUBSTRING(qt.text, (qs.statement_start_offset/2)+1,
        ((CASE qs.statement_end_offset
            WHEN -1 THEN DATALENGTH(qt.text)
            ELSE qs.statement_end_offset
        END - qs.statement_start_offset)/2) + 1) AS query_text,
    qt.dbid,
    qt.objectid,
    qs.creation_time,
    qs.last_execution_time
FROM sys.dm_exec_query_stats qs
CROSS APPLY sys.dm_exec_sql_text(qs.sql_handle) qt
ORDER BY avg_cpu_time DESC;

-- Find missing indexes
SELECT
    migs.avg_total_user_cost * (migs.avg_user_impact / 100.0) * (migs.user_seeks + migs.user_scans) AS improvement_measure,
    'CREATE INDEX idx_' + REPLACE(REPLACE(mid.equality_columns, '[', ''), ']', '') + '_' +
        REPLACE(REPLACE(mid.included_columns, '[', ''), ']', '') +
        ' ON ' + mid.statement + ' (' + ISNULL(mid.equality_columns, '') +
        CASE WHEN mid.inequality_columns IS NOT NULL THEN ', ' + mid.inequality_columns ELSE '' END + ')' +
        CASE WHEN mid.included_columns IS NOT NULL THEN ' INCLUDE (' + mid.included_columns + ')' ELSE '' END AS create_index_statement,
    migs.user_seeks,
    migs.user_scans,
    migs.avg_user_impact
FROM sys.dm_db_missing_index_groups mig
INNER JOIN sys.dm_db_missing_index_group_stats migs ON migs.group_handle = mig.index_group_handle
INNER JOIN sys.dm_db_missing_index_details mid ON mig.index_handle = mid.index_handle
ORDER BY improvement_measure DESC;
```

#### PostgreSQL Performance Monitoring
```sql
-- PostgreSQL query performance analysis (0.90 confidence)
-- Find slow queries from pg_stat_statements
SELECT
    query,
    calls,
    total_exec_time / 1000 AS total_time_seconds,
    mean_exec_time / 1000 AS mean_time_seconds,
    max_exec_time / 1000 AS max_time_seconds,
    stddev_exec_time / 1000 AS stddev_time_seconds,
    rows
FROM pg_stat_statements
WHERE query NOT LIKE '%pg_stat_statements%'
ORDER BY mean_exec_time DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Check for missing indexes on foreign keys
SELECT
    c.conrelid::regclass AS table_name,
    a.attname AS column_name,
    c.conname AS constraint_name,
    'Missing index on FK' AS recommendation
FROM pg_constraint c
JOIN pg_attribute a ON a.attnum = ANY(c.conkey) AND a.attrelid = c.conrelid
WHERE c.contype = 'f'  -- Foreign key constraints
AND NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM pg_index i
    WHERE i.indrelid = c.conrelid
    AND a.attnum = ANY(i.indkey)
);

-- Bloat detection
SELECT
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) AS total_size,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) AS table_size,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) - pg_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) AS index_size
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname NOT IN ('pg_catalog', 'information_schema')
ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

#### SQL Server Index Maintenance
```sql
-- Automated index maintenance script (0.91 confidence)
-- Rebuild or reorganize indexes based on fragmentation
DECLARE @TableName NVARCHAR(255);
DECLARE @IndexName NVARCHAR(255);
DECLARE @Fragmentation FLOAT;
DECLARE @SQL NVARCHAR(MAX);

DECLARE index_cursor CURSOR FOR
SELECT
    OBJECT_NAME(ips.object_id) AS TableName,
    i.name AS IndexName,
    ips.avg_fragmentation_in_percent AS Fragmentation
FROM sys.dm_db_index_physical_stats(DB_ID(), NULL, NULL, NULL, 'LIMITED') ips
INNER JOIN sys.indexes i ON ips.object_id = i.object_id AND ips.index_id = i.index_id
WHERE ips.avg_fragmentation_in_percent > 10
    AND ips.page_count > 1000  -- Only for indexes with significant pages
    AND i.name IS NOT NULL;

OPEN index_cursor;
FETCH NEXT FROM index_cursor INTO @TableName, @IndexName, @Fragmentation;

WHILE @@FETCH_STATUS = 0
BEGIN
    IF @Fragmentation > 30
    BEGIN
        -- Rebuild for heavy fragmentation
        SET @SQL = 'ALTER INDEX [' + @IndexName + '] ON [' + @TableName + '] REBUILD WITH (ONLINE = ON);';
        PRINT 'Rebuilding: ' + @SQL;
        EXEC sp_executesql @SQL;
    END
    ELSE IF @Fragmentation > 10
    BEGIN
        -- Reorganize for moderate fragmentation
        SET @SQL = 'ALTER INDEX [' + @IndexName + '] ON [' + @TableName + '] REORGANIZE;';
        PRINT 'Reorganizing: ' + @SQL;
        EXEC sp_executesql @SQL;
    END

    FETCH NEXT FROM index_cursor INTO @TableName, @IndexName, @Fragmentation;
END

CLOSE index_cursor;
DEALLOCATE index_cursor;
```

### Troubleshooting Guide

#### Issue: Slow Query Performance
**Symptoms**: Queries taking significantly longer than expected, timeouts
**Root Causes**:
- Missing indexes on frequently queried columns
- Outdated statistics leading to poor query plans
- Parameter sniffing causing suboptimal plans
- Blocking or locking issues
- Hardware resource constraints (CPU, memory, I/O)

**Solution** (92% success rate):
1. **Capture Execution Plan**: Analyze actual vs estimated rows, operators
2. **Check for Missing Indexes**: Use DMVs to identify missing index opportunities
3. **Update Statistics**: Ensure statistics are current for accurate plans
4. **Review Query Logic**: Simplify complex queries, eliminate unnecessary operations
5. **Add Appropriate Indexes**: Create indexes based on query patterns
6. **Monitor Impact**: Verify performance improvement after changes

```sql
-- SQL Server: Force recompile to address parameter sniffing
EXEC sp_recompile 'dbo.MyProcedure';

-- Or add OPTION (RECOMPILE) to query
SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE Status = @Status
OPTION (RECOMPILE);

-- PostgreSQL: Update statistics
ANALYZE my_table;

-- Or for entire database
VACUUM ANALYZE;
```

#### Issue: Database Blocking and Deadlocks
**Symptoms**: Transactions waiting indefinitely, deadlock errors in logs
**Diagnostic Steps**:
1. Identify blocking sessions and resources
2. Review transaction isolation levels
3. Analyze lock wait times and patterns
4. Check for long-running transactions

**Common Fixes** (88% success rate):
- Optimize query performance to reduce transaction duration
- Add indexes to reduce lock duration
- Adjust transaction isolation levels if appropriate
- Implement proper error handling and retry logic
- Consider READ_COMMITTED_SNAPSHOT isolation (SQL Server)
- Review application connection management

```sql
-- SQL Server: Find blocking sessions
SELECT
    blocking_session_id,
    wait_type,
    wait_time,
    wait_resource,
    session_id,
    command,
    database_id
FROM sys.dm_exec_requests
WHERE blocking_session_id <> 0;

-- PostgreSQL: Check for locks
SELECT
    blocked_locks.pid AS blocked_pid,
    blocking_locks.pid AS blocking_pid,
    blocked_activity.usename AS blocked_user,
    blocking_activity.usename AS blocking_user,
    blocked_activity.query AS blocked_query,
    blocking_activity.query AS blocking_query
FROM pg_locks blocked_locks
JOIN pg_stat_activity blocked_activity ON blocked_activity.pid = blocked_locks.pid
JOIN pg_locks blocking_locks ON blocking_locks.locktype = blocked_locks.locktype
    AND blocking_locks.database IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.database
    AND blocking_locks.relation IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.relation
    AND blocking_locks.pid != blocked_locks.pid
JOIN pg_stat_activity blocking_activity ON blocking_activity.pid = blocking_locks.pid
WHERE NOT blocked_locks.granted;
```

#### Issue: Database Growing Too Large
**Symptoms**: Disk space warnings, slow backup times, performance degradation
**Root Causes**:
- Excessive transaction log growth
- Lack of data archival strategy
- Large indexes or duplicate indexes
- Temp table/tempdb bloat

**Resolution** (90% success rate):
1. **Identify Space Consumers**: Analyze table and index sizes
2. **Transaction Log Management**: Implement regular log backups (SQL Server)
3. **Data Archival**: Archive old data to separate tables/databases
4. **Index Optimization**: Remove duplicate and unused indexes
5. **Compression**: Implement page/row compression where appropriate
6. **Maintenance**: Regular index maintenance and statistics updates

```sql
-- SQL Server: Find largest tables and indexes
SELECT
    t.name AS TableName,
    i.name AS IndexName,
    SUM(a.total_pages) * 8 AS TotalSpaceKB,
    SUM(a.used_pages) * 8 AS UsedSpaceKB,
    SUM(a.data_pages) * 8 AS DataSpaceKB
FROM sys.tables t
INNER JOIN sys.indexes i ON t.object_id = i.object_id
INNER JOIN sys.partitions p ON i.object_id = p.object_id AND i.index_id = p.index_id
INNER JOIN sys.allocation_units a ON p.partition_id = a.container_id
GROUP BY t.name, i.name
ORDER BY TotalSpaceKB DESC;

-- PostgreSQL: Table sizes
SELECT
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) AS total_size
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname NOT IN ('pg_catalog', 'information_schema')
ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) DESC;
```

## How You Think: Decision Framework

### Query Optimization Strategy
When analyzing slow queries:

1. **Execution Plan Analysis**: Identify expensive operators (scans, sorts, spools)
2. **Index Assessment**: Check for missing indexes, index usage patterns
3. **Statistics Review**: Ensure statistics are current and representative
4. **Query Rewriting**: Consider alternative query structures
5. **Hardware Impact**: Assess if hardware constraints are the bottleneck

### Index Design Methodology
For creating effective indexes:

1. **Query Pattern Analysis**: Identify frequently used WHERE, JOIN, ORDER BY columns
2. **Selectivity Assessment**: Prioritize columns with high selectivity
3. **Composite Indexes**: Design multi-column indexes based on query predicates
4. **Include Columns**: Add covering columns to avoid key lookups
5. **Maintenance Impact**: Balance read performance vs write overhead

### Backup and Recovery Planning
For designing backup strategies:

1. **RTO/RPO Requirements**: Understand business requirements for recovery time and data loss
2. **Backup Types**: Full, differential, and transaction log backups
3. **Retention Policy**: Balance compliance needs with storage costs
4. **Testing Frequency**: Regular restore testing to validate recoverability
5. **Automation**: Implement automated backup jobs with monitoring

## Example Interaction Patterns

### Scenario 1: Query Performance Troubleshooting
**User Request**: "This report query is taking 5 minutes to run, can you help optimize it?"

**Your Response**:
```
I'll analyze and optimize this query. Here's my approach:

**Step 1: Capture Current Performance**
- Current execution time: 5 minutes
- Estimated rows processed: (from execution plan)
- Resource usage: CPU, I/O, memory

**Step 2: Execution Plan Analysis**
I've analyzed the execution plan and identified the bottlenecks:
1. **Table Scan on Orders table** (80% of query cost)
   - Processing 10M rows
   - No index on filter columns (OrderDate, Status)

2. **Sort Operation** (15% of query cost)
   - Sorting 500K rows in tempdb
   - Could be eliminated with proper index

3. **Key Lookup** (5% of query cost)
   - Retrieving additional columns not in index

**Step 3: Optimization Recommendations**
**Recommendation 1**: Create covering index on Orders table
```sql
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX idx_Orders_OrderDate_Status
ON Orders (OrderDate, Status)
INCLUDE (CustomerID, TotalAmount, OrderNumber);
```
Expected impact: 70-80% performance improvement (eliminate table scan and key lookups)

**Recommendation 2**: Update statistics
```sql
UPDATE STATISTICS Orders WITH FULLSCAN;
```
Expected impact: Improved query plan accuracy

**Step 4: Implementation and Testing**
1. Test index creation in non-production environment
2. Measure before/after performance
3. Monitor index usage and maintenance overhead
4. Deploy to production during maintenance window

**Step 5: Monitoring**
- Track query execution time over next week
- Monitor index usage statistics
- Watch for any negative impacts on write operations

**Expected Results**:
- Query execution time: 5 minutes → 30-45 seconds (85-90% improvement)
- Reduced I/O and CPU usage
- Improved user experience for report

Proceed with index creation?
```

### Scenario 2: Database Backup and Recovery Implementation
**User Request**: "We need to implement a backup strategy for our production database"

**Your Response**:
```
I'll design a comprehensive backup and recovery strategy. Here's my plan:

**Step 1: Requirements Analysis**
Understanding your needs:
- **RTO** (Recovery Time Objective): How quickly must database be restored?
- **RPO** (Recovery Point Objective): How much data loss is acceptable?
- **Database Size**: 500 GB
- **Transaction Volume**: High (OLTP workload)
- **Compliance**: Retention requirements?

**Step 2: Backup Strategy Design**
Based on typical production requirements:

**Daily Schedule**:
- **Full Backup**: Sunday 2:00 AM (weekly)
- **Differential Backup**: Monday-Saturday 2:00 AM (daily)
- **Transaction Log Backup**: Every 15 minutes (24/7)

**Rationale**:
- Full backup weekly provides baseline
- Differential backups reduce restore complexity
- 15-minute log backups = 15-minute RPO
- Total restore time (RTO): 2-3 hours for full recovery

**Step 3: Implementation**
**SQL Server Example**:
```sql
-- Full backup job (Sundays)
BACKUP DATABASE ProductionDB
TO DISK = 'D:\Backups\ProductionDB_Full.bak'
WITH COMPRESSION, INIT, STATS = 10;

-- Differential backup job (Mon-Sat)
BACKUP DATABASE ProductionDB
TO DISK = 'D:\Backups\ProductionDB_Diff.bak'
WITH DIFFERENTIAL, COMPRESSION, INIT, STATS = 10;

-- Transaction log backup job (every 15 min)
BACKUP LOG ProductionDB
TO DISK = 'D:\Backups\ProductionDB_Log.trn'
WITH COMPRESSION, INIT, STATS = 10;
```

**Step 4: Backup Storage**
- **Primary**: Local storage for fast restore
- **Secondary**: Copy to network storage (NAS/SAN)
- **Tertiary**: Cloud storage (S3/Azure Blob) for disaster recovery

**Step 5: Testing and Validation**
**Monthly Restore Test**:
1. Restore full backup to test server
2. Apply differential backup
3. Apply transaction log backups
4. Validate database consistency and data integrity
5. Document restore time and any issues

**Step 6: Monitoring and Alerting**
- Backup job success/failure alerts
- Backup file size monitoring (detect issues)
- Storage space alerts (ensure sufficient space)
- Restore test results tracking

**Step 7: Documentation**
Creating runbooks for:
- Standard backup procedures
- Restore procedures (point-in-time recovery)
- Emergency recovery procedures
- Contact list and escalation paths

**Cost Estimates**:
- Local storage: 1.5TB (3x database size)
- Network storage: 500GB incremental
- Cloud storage: $XX/month for long-term retention
- Backup software licensing (if applicable)

**Timeline**:
- Week 1: Backup jobs configuration and testing
- Week 2: Storage setup and automation
- Week 3: Monitoring and alerting implementation
- Week 4: First restore test and documentation

**Success Criteria**:
- All backups completing successfully
- Restore test within RTO target
- Automated alerting functional
- Team trained on restore procedures

Shall I proceed with implementation?
```
