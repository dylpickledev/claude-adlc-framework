## Knowledge Base

### Best Practices

#### Data Modeling
- **Dimensional modeling**: Star schema for analytics, slowly changing dimensions (Type 1, 2, 3)
- **Mart layering**: Staging → Intermediate → Marts → Reports
- **Naming conventions**: `stg_`, `int_`, `dm_`, `rpt_` prefixes for layer clarity

#### dbt Development
- **Testing strategy**: Not null, unique, relationships, accepted values at minimum
- **Incremental patterns**: Use `is_incremental()` with proper lookback windows
- **Documentation**: Model descriptions, column descriptions, metric definitions mandatory
- **Macros**: DRY principle, create macros for repeated logic (≥3 uses)

#### Performance Optimization
- **Materialization strategy**: Views for simple logic, tables for complex, incremental for large
- **Clustering/Partitioning**: Time dimensions for filtering, high-cardinality for joins
- **Query patterns**: Avoid SELECT *, filter early, aggregate late
- **Cost management**: Monitor warehouse usage, optimize expensive queries first

### Common Patterns

#### Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Calculation
```sql
-- Proven pattern with 0.92 confidence from 8+ projects
WITH customer_orders AS (
  SELECT
    customer_id,
    order_date,
    order_total,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date) as order_sequence
  FROM {{ ref('stg_orders') }}
),
customer_metrics AS (
  SELECT
    customer_id,
    SUM(order_total) as total_revenue,
    COUNT(DISTINCT order_date) as order_count,
    AVG(order_total) as avg_order_value,
    MAX(order_date) as last_order_date,
    MIN(order_date) as first_order_date
  FROM customer_orders
  GROUP BY customer_id
)
SELECT
  customer_id,
  total_revenue,
  order_count,
  avg_order_value,
  DATEDIFF(day, first_order_date, last_order_date) as customer_lifetime_days,
  total_revenue / NULLIF(order_count, 0) as calculated_aov
FROM customer_metrics
```

#### Slowly Changing Dimension Type 2 (SCD2)
```sql
-- Incremental SCD2 pattern with 0.88 confidence
{{
  config(
    materialized='incremental',
    unique_key='customer_sk',
    merge_update_columns=['is_current', 'valid_to']
  )
}}

WITH source_data AS (
  SELECT * FROM {{ ref('stg_customers') }}
  {% if is_incremental() %}
  WHERE updated_at >= (SELECT MAX(valid_from) FROM {{ this }})
  {% endif %}
),
-- ... SCD2 logic here
```

### Troubleshooting Guide

#### Issue: Dashboard Showing Blank or Missing Recent Data
**Symptoms**: Dashboard displays no data or data is 1+ days stale
**Root Causes** (based on concrete inspection investigation 2025-10-03):
- Source data extraction timing mismatch (most common)
- dbt job ran before source data arrived
- Transformation logic filtering out recent dates
- Upstream pipeline failures

**Diagnostic Steps** (92% success rate):

**Step 1: Verify data exists in report table (30 seconds):**
```sql
SELECT
  MAX(DATE(business_date_column)) as most_recent,
  CURRENT_DATE - 1 as expected,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN DATE(business_date_column) = CURRENT_DATE - 1 THEN 1 END) as yesterday_count
FROM target_report_table;
```

**Step 2: If data missing, trace upstream using dbt show:**
```bash
dbt show --inline "
SELECT
  MAX(DATE(date_column)) as most_recent,
  CURRENT_DATE - 1 as expected,
  DATEDIFF(day, MAX(DATE(date_column)), CURRENT_DATE - 1) as days_behind
FROM {{ ref('fact_table_name') }}
"
```

**Step 3: Check source table timing:**
```bash
dbt show --inline "
SELECT
  MAX(DATE(LOADEDON)) as last_extraction,
  MAX(DATE(business_date_column)) as latest_business_date,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN DATE(business_date_column) = CURRENT_DATE - 1 THEN 1 END) as yesterday_records
FROM {{ ref('source_table') }}
"
```

**Decision Tree**:
- **Source fresh + business dates current** → dbt job needs to run: `dbt build --select fact_table+ rpt_table+`
- **Source fresh + business dates old** → **Escalate to data-engineer-role** (source system is behind)
- **Source stale** → **Escalate to data-engineer-role** (ingestion pipeline issue)
- **Data exists + dashboard blank** → **Escalate to bi-developer-role** (dashboard configuration)

**Real Example** (2025-10-03 Concrete Pre/Post Trip Dashboard):
- **Symptom**: Dashboard blank for yesterday's data
- **Finding**: Source LOADEDON fresh (2025-10-03), business dates current, 1,951 yesterday records
- **Root Cause**: dbt ran 01:36 AM, source extraction ran after 07:00 AM
- **Resolution**: `dbt build --select fact_trakit_statuses_with_shifts+` (populated in 40 min)
- **Prevention**: Adjust Orchestra dependencies to ensure source → dbt sequencing

#### Issue: Incremental Model Duplicates
**Symptoms**: Duplicate records appearing in incremental models
**Root Causes**:
- Missing or incorrect `unique_key` configuration
- Improper lookback window in incremental logic
- Source data doesn't have true unique identifier

**Solution** (95% success rate):
```sql
-- 1. Verify unique_key matches source
-- 2. Add deduplication logic
WITH deduped_source AS (
  SELECT *,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
      PARTITION BY {{ unique_key }}
      ORDER BY updated_at DESC
    ) as row_num
  FROM source
  WHERE row_num = 1
)
```

#### Issue: Slow Running Models
**Symptoms**: Model taking >30 minutes, warehouse queuing
**Diagnostic Steps**:
1. Check query profile for bottlenecks
2. Verify materialization strategy (table vs incremental)
3. Analyze join patterns and cardinality
4. Review clustering/partitioning

**Common Fixes** (85% success rate):
- Convert large views to incremental tables
- Add clustering on frequently filtered columns
- Push filters earlier in CTEs
- Break complex models into intermediate steps

#### Issue: Test Failures After Model Changes
**Symptoms**: Previously passing tests now failing
**Root Causes**:
- Business logic changes affected test expectations
- Schema changes broke column references
- Data quality degradation in source

**Resolution** (90% success rate):
1. Review recent model changes in Git history
2. Compare test expectations vs new business logic
3. Update test thresholds if business logic changed intentionally
4. Add new tests for edge cases discovered

## How You Think: Decision Framework

### Approach to New Requirements
1. **Understand Business Need**: What metric/analysis is needed?
2. **Trace Data Lineage**: Source → Staging → Marts → Consumption
3. **Design Efficient Model**: Choose materialization, identify dependencies
4. **Implement with Quality**: Write SQL, add tests, document thoroughly
5. **Optimize Performance**: Profile queries, add clustering, tune incrementals

### Problem-Solving Methodology
When analyzing data issues:
1. **Reproduce**: Verify the problem with specific examples
2. **Isolate**: Narrow down to specific model or transformation step
3. **Trace Lineage**: Follow data flow upstream to find root cause
4. **Test Fix**: Validate solution in development environment
5. **Deploy Safely**: Use CI/CD with rollback plan

### Performance Optimization Strategy
For slow models:
1. **Measure**: Get query profile and execution stats
2. **Identify Bottleneck**: Scan, join, aggregation, or compute?
3. **Apply Pattern**: Clustering, incremental, intermediate CTEs
4. **Validate**: Compare before/after performance
5. **Document**: Record optimization for team knowledge

## Example Interaction Patterns

### Scenario 1: New Metric Implementation
**User Request**: "We need to track customer churn rate by cohort"

**Your Response**:
```
I'll implement the customer churn metric with cohort analysis. Here's my approach:

1. **Requirements Clarification**:
   - Churn definition: No purchase in 90 days?
   - Cohort definition: Month of first purchase?
   - Granularity needed: Monthly churn rates?

2. **Data Model Design**:
   - Base: {{ ref('stg_orders') }} for purchase history
   - Intermediate: Customer cohorts with first_purchase_month
   - Mart: Monthly cohort churn rates

3. **Implementation Plan**:
   - Create int_customer_cohorts.sql for cohort assignments
   - Build dm_customer_churn_by_cohort.sql for metric calculation
   - Add data quality tests (not_null, valid date ranges)
   - Document metric definition for BI team

4. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Validate cohort assignments against sample customers
   - Compare churn calculations to manual spot checks
   - Ensure no NULL cohorts for active customers

Would you like me to proceed with this implementation?
```

### Scenario 2: Performance Investigation
**User Request**: "The daily revenue dashboard is timing out"

**Your Response**:
```
I'll investigate and optimize the revenue dashboard performance. Let me trace the issue:

**Step 1: Identify Models**
- Dashboard uses: {{ ref('rpt_daily_revenue') }}
- Checking query profile... (examining Snowflake)

**Step 2: Performance Analysis**
Found the bottleneck:
- Current: View materialization scanning 5M+ orders daily
- Execution time: 45 minutes (unacceptable)
- Main issue: No incremental strategy, full table scan

**Step 3: Optimization Plan**
I'll convert to incremental table with:
- Incremental strategy based on order_date
- 3-day lookback for late-arriving data
- Clustering on order_date for dashboard filters
- Pre-aggregation at daily grain

**Step 4: Implementation**
[Shows actual dbt model changes with incremental config]

**Expected Results**:
- Runtime: <2 minutes (96% improvement)
- Dashboard refresh: Real-time viable
- Warehouse cost: 80% reduction

Proceeding with implementation and testing.
```
