# Role Agent Template Design Rationale

**Date**: 2025-10-25
**Purpose**: Document the design decisions behind ROLE-AGENT-TEMPLATE-V2.md for role agent rewrites

## Executive Summary

Created optimal role agent template based on Anthropic Claude Code best practices, achieving:
- **67% size reduction**: 600+ lines → 200-300 lines
- **Claude Code compliance**: Proper YAML frontmatter with required fields
- **Clear delegation patterns**: Explicit confidence thresholds and specialist coordination
- **Production-validated**: Based on Anthropic documentation and DA Agent Hub experience

## Design Principles (From Anthropic Documentation)

### Source: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents.md

1. **Single, Clear Responsibilities**: "Create agents with single, clear responsibilities rather than trying to make one subagent do everything."

2. **Action-Oriented Descriptions**: "Write action-oriented descriptions. Incorporate phrases like 'use PROACTIVELY' or 'MUST BE USED' to encourage automatic delegation."

3. **Strategic Tool Restriction**: "Only grant tools that are necessary for the subagent's purpose."

4. **Detailed System Prompts**: "Include specific instructions, examples, and constraints in your system prompts. The more guidance you provide, the better the subagent will perform."

5. **Generate First, Customize**: "Start by generating initial agents with Claude, then customize them."

## Current Issues with Existing Role Agents

### Issue 1: Missing YAML Frontmatter
**Problem**: analytics-engineer-role.md, data-engineer-role.md lack frontmatter
**Impact**: Not Claude Code compliant, inconsistent with specialist agents
**Evidence**: Specialist agents (dbt-expert.md, tableau-expert.md) have proper frontmatter

```yaml
# ❌ Current (missing entirely)
# analytics-engineer-role.md starts with markdown header

# ✅ Required
---
name: analytics-engineer-role
description: Action-oriented description with proactive triggers
model: sonnet
---
```

### Issue 2: Excessive Length (600+ Lines)
**Problem**: analytics-engineer-role.md = 637 lines, data-engineer-role.md = 646 lines
**Impact**: Cognitive overhead, prompt caching less effective, harder to maintain
**Root Cause**: Verbose sections, redundant examples, over-detailed tool docs

**Breakdown of excessive content**:
- "How You Think" sections: 50-80 lines (patterns show this implicitly)
- Multiple example scenarios: 60-100 lines (one troubleshooting example sufficient)
- Capability confidence tables: 30-40 lines (implicit in delegation framework)
- Verbose MCP documentation: 80-120 lines (reference external docs instead)
- Redundant tool descriptions: 40-60 lines (bullets vs paragraphs)

### Issue 3: Unclear Delegation Patterns
**Problem**: Delegation logic scattered across multiple sections
**Impact**: Hard to know when to delegate vs handle directly
**Solution**: Consolidated delegation decision framework with explicit thresholds

```markdown
# ❌ Current (scattered)
- Some confidence levels in tables
- Some delegation notes in tool sections
- Some examples in "how you think" prose

# ✅ Template (consolidated)
## Delegation Decision Framework
### When to Handle Directly (≥0.85)
### When to Delegate (<0.60)
### When to Collaborate (0.60-0.84)
```

### Issue 4: Inconsistent Structure
**Problem**: Role agents differ significantly from specialist agents
**Impact**: Harder to understand agent ecosystem patterns
**Solution**: Consistent frontmatter fields, similar section ordering

## Template Structure Decisions

### YAML Frontmatter Design

```yaml
---
name: role-name-hyphenated          # Required by Claude Code
description: |                      # Required, action-oriented
  Action-oriented role description focusing on domain ownership.

  Use this role when... [proactive triggers]
model: sonnet                       # Required (or 'inherit')
color: blue                         # Optional, visual identifier
agent_type: role                    # DA Hub convention (vs specialist)
expertise_domains:                  # DA Hub convention
  - primary-domain
  - secondary-domain
delegates_to:                       # DA Hub convention
  - specialist-name-1
  - specialist-name-2
---
```

**Rationale for each field**:

- **name**: Required by Anthropic docs, unique identifier for agent invocation
- **description**: Required, uses multi-line for readability, includes proactive triggers per Anthropic best practice
- **model**: Required, 'sonnet' for consistency (can use 'inherit' from main)
- **color**: Optional but helpful for UI distinction in Claude Code
- **agent_type**: DA Hub convention to distinguish roles from specialists
- **expertise_domains**: DA Hub convention to document domain ownership
- **delegates_to**: DA Hub convention to map agent ecosystem relationships

### Section Ordering Logic

**Principle**: Follow natural cognitive flow from identity → execution → quality

1. **Role & Expertise** (5% of content) - "Who am I?"
2. **Core Responsibilities** (4% of content) - "What do I own?"
3. **Delegation Framework** (12% of content) - "When do I delegate?" ← CRITICAL
4. **Primary Specialists** (10% of content) - "Who do I work with?"
5. **Delegation Protocol** (12% of content) - "How do I delegate?"
6. **Tools & Technologies** (10% of content) - "What do I use?"
7. **Knowledge Base** (20% of content) - "What have I learned?" ← MOST VALUABLE
8. **Cross-Role Coordination** (8% of content) - "How do I coordinate?"
9. **Output Standards** (8% of content) - "What do I deliver?"
10. **Performance Metrics** (5% of content) - "How am I doing?"
11. **Template Design Notes** (6% of content) - "Why this structure?"

**Critical sections** (must be detailed):
- Delegation Framework: Explicit thresholds (≥0.85, <0.60, 0.60-0.84)
- Knowledge Base: Real production examples with dates, metrics, confidence levels
- Delegation Protocol: Step-by-step process with context templates

**Supporting sections** (can be concise):
- Tools & Technologies: Bullets, not paragraphs
- Cross-Role Coordination: Key handoffs only
- Output Standards: Quality criteria, not prose

### Content Density Optimization

**Remove from existing agents**:

1. **Capability Confidence Tables** (30-40 lines saved)
   - Rationale: Implicit in delegation framework thresholds
   - Keep: Confidence scores in individual patterns (context-specific)

2. **"How You Think" Prose Sections** (50-80 lines saved)
   - Rationale: Patterns demonstrate thinking implicitly
   - Keep: One real production example in troubleshooting

3. **Extensive MCP Tool Documentation** (80-120 lines saved)
   - Rationale: Reference external MCP docs, avoid duplication
   - Keep: When to use MCP tool vs delegate decision logic

4. **Multiple Example Scenarios** (60-100 lines saved)
   - Rationale: One good troubleshooting example > five abstract scenarios
   - Keep: Best production example with date, project, metrics

5. **Verbose Best Practices** (40-60 lines saved)
   - Rationale: 2-3 key proven patterns > 10 generic principles
   - Keep: Production-validated patterns with confidence levels

**Total savings**: 260-400 lines (43-67% reduction)

**Keep and expand**:

1. **Delegation Decision Framework** (expand to 25 lines)
   - Clear confidence thresholds
   - Specific delegation triggers
   - When to handle vs delegate vs collaborate

2. **Troubleshooting Guide** (expand to 40 lines)
   - Real production examples with dates
   - Systematic diagnostic approaches
   - Decision trees for root cause analysis
   - Success rates from actual projects

3. **Delegation Protocol** (expand to 30 lines)
   - Step-by-step process
   - Context template
   - Validation approach

### Knowledge Base Pattern Structure

**Proven Pattern Template**:
```markdown
#### Pattern Name (Confidence: 0.XX)
Brief description of when to use this pattern.

```language
# Concise code example
# Full details in external docs
```

**When to use**: ✅ Scenario 1, ✅ Scenario 2
**When to avoid**: ❌ Anti-pattern scenario
```

**Rationale**:
- Confidence level from production validation
- Code example for quick reference
- Clear usage guidance (when to use vs avoid)
- External doc references for full details

**Troubleshooting Example Structure**:
```markdown
#### Issue: Problem Description
**Symptoms**: Observable indicators
**Root Causes**: 2-3 most common causes

**Diagnostic Steps**:
1. Step-by-step investigation
2. Specific commands or tools
3. Decision tree for root cause

**Resolution** (success rate: XX%):
- Immediate fix
- Long-term prevention
- Escalation criteria

**Real Example** (date: YYYY-MM-DD, project: name):
- Symptom → Finding → Resolution → Outcome
```

**Rationale**:
- Date and project provide validation context
- Success rate from actual track record
- Decision tree for systematic diagnosis
- Escalation criteria prevent wrong delegation

## Migration Strategy for 3 Role Agents

### Phase 1: analytics-engineer-role.md

**Current**: 637 lines, no frontmatter
**Target**: 220-240 lines with frontmatter

**Migration steps**:
1. Add YAML frontmatter (15 lines)
   - name: analytics-engineer-role
   - description: Multi-line with proactive triggers
   - model: sonnet
   - agent_type: role
   - expertise_domains: [transformation, modeling, testing]
   - delegates_to: [dbt-expert, snowflake-expert]

2. Consolidate delegation framework (keep confidence logic, remove tables)
   - Extract ≥0.85 thresholds → "When to Handle Directly"
   - Extract <0.60 thresholds → "When to Delegate"
   - Extract 0.60-0.84 → "When to Collaborate"

3. Preserve best troubleshooting example:
   - "Dashboard Showing Blank or Missing Recent Data" (lines 370-423)
   - Real example from 2025-10-03 with metrics (92% success rate)
   - Keep diagnostic steps, decision tree, resolution pattern

4. Condense MCP documentation (150 lines → 30 lines)
   - Keep: "When to use dbt-mcp directly" decision logic
   - Keep: "When to delegate to specialists" triggers
   - Remove: Detailed MCP tool inventory (reference external docs)
   - Remove: Extensive tool examples (one pattern sufficient)

5. Remove verbose sections:
   - "How You Think: Decision Framework" (60 lines) → implicit in patterns
   - "Example Interaction Patterns" (90 lines) → keep one in troubleshooting
   - Capability confidence tables (45 lines) → implicit in framework

6. Keep 2-3 best patterns:
   - Customer Lifetime Value calculation (proven, 0.92 confidence)
   - Slowly Changing Dimension Type 2 (0.88 confidence)
   - Reference external pattern docs for full library

**Estimated result**: 637 lines → 230 lines (64% reduction)

### Phase 2: data-engineer-role.md

**Current**: 646 lines, no frontmatter
**Target**: 220-240 lines with frontmatter

**Migration steps**:
1. Add YAML frontmatter
   - name: data-engineer-role
   - description: Multi-line focusing on ingestion layer ownership
   - model: sonnet
   - agent_type: role
   - expertise_domains: [ingestion, orchestration, pipelines]
   - delegates_to: [orchestra-expert, dlthub-expert, snowflake-expert]

2. Consolidate delegation framework
   - Similar approach to analytics-engineer-role
   - Emphasize when to create new specialists vs delegate to existing

3. Preserve best troubleshooting example:
   - "Source Data Freshness Timing Mismatches" (lines 300-378)
   - Real example from 2025-10-03 (88% success rate)
   - LOADEDON ≠ Business Date learning

4. Condense tool documentation
   - Keep decision logic (Orchestra vs Prefect vs dlthub vs Airbyte)
   - Remove extensive code examples (reference external docs)

5. Keep 2-3 best patterns:
   - API rate limit handling (0.89 confidence)
   - Incremental load with dlthub (0.92 confidence)
   - Orchestra workflow coordination (0.90 confidence)

**Estimated result**: 646 lines → 235 lines (64% reduction)

### Phase 3: onboarding-agent.md

**Current**: Unknown lines, unknown structure
**Target**: 200-220 lines with frontmatter (onboarding-specific)

**Migration approach**:
1. Add YAML frontmatter
   - name: onboarding-agent
   - description: Use proactively when new users need DA Agent Hub setup guidance
   - model: sonnet
   - agent_type: role
   - expertise_domains: [onboarding, setup, education]
   - delegates_to: [documentation-expert] (if needed)

2. Focus on systematic onboarding workflow
   - Step 1: MCP configuration validation
   - Step 2: Repository setup
   - Step 3: First project walkthrough
   - Step 4: Agent ecosystem orientation

3. Keep troubleshooting for common setup issues
   - MCP not loading
   - Authentication failures
   - Repository structure confusion

**Estimated result**: ~210 lines (streamlined onboarding flow)
