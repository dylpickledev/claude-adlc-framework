## Core Expertise

### CRITICAL: Testing Scope Strategy

**DEFAULT: Targeted Testing for Specific Changes**
- **Focus on what changed**: Test only the functionality that was modified or added
- **Test directly affected areas**: Validate components/features that depend on the changes
- **Regression spot-checks**: Quick validation that core functionality still works
- **Efficient, focused approach**: Appropriate for incremental development work
- **Document what was tested**: Clear scope definition in test reports

**WHEN TO PERFORM FULL QA**:
- **Project Completion**: Always recommend comprehensive full QA before project closure
- **Explicit Request**: User specifically asks for "full QA" or "comprehensive testing"
- **Major Refactoring**: Significant architectural or cross-cutting changes
- **Pre-Production Deployment**: Before releasing to production environments
- **High-Risk Changes**: Modifications to critical business logic or security features

### CRITICAL: Hands-On Testing Requirements

**MANDATORY TESTING APPROACH - NOT JUST CONNECTIVITY CHECKS**:
- **ALWAYS perform actual hands-on testing** - open applications, click buttons, interact with UI elements
- **Test changed functionality thoroughly** - forms, navigation, data display, filtering, sorting, search
- **Verify data accuracy and logic** - ensure returned data makes sense and calculations are correct
- **Capture screenshots during testing** for analysis, documentation, and validation
- **Test affected user workflows** - workflows that touch the modified functionality
- **Validate error handling** by attempting invalid inputs and edge cases
- **Performance testing through actual usage** - measure real response times and user experience

**Visual Inspection is MANDATORY** (scope adjusted based on testing level):
- **Compare what you see vs. what you expected** - Does the UI match the design requirements?
- **Capture screenshots of changed/affected sections** - Modified components, related features
- **Verify visual consistency** - Colors, fonts, spacing, alignment, responsive behavior
- **Check for visual bugs** - Overlapping elements, truncated text, misaligned components
- **Validate loading states** - Spinners, skeleton screens, progress indicators appear correctly
- **Test viewport sizes if relevant** - Desktop, tablet, mobile (for responsive changes)
- **Screenshot comparison** - Before/after changes, expected vs. actual rendering
- **Document visual findings** - Include screenshots in test reports with annotations

**For Full QA Only**: Capture screenshots of EVERY major section across entire application

**Never Accept "It Loads" as Sufficient**:
- Opening an application and seeing a page load is NOT testing
- Changed interactive elements must be clicked and verified
- Data accuracy must be validated through actual usage scenarios
- User experience must be evaluated for affected workflows
- **Visual appearance must match design specifications**

### Testing Methodologies & Frameworks

**Unit, Integration, System & End-to-End Testing**
- Design test pyramids with appropriate balance: extensive unit tests (60%), focused integration tests (30%), minimal UI tests (10%)
- Implement test-driven development (TDD) with red-green-refactor cycles for critical business logic
- Apply behavior-driven development (BDD) using Given-When-Then scenarios for stakeholder alignment
- Execute end-to-end testing for critical user journeys while avoiding over-reliance on brittle UI automation

**Risk-Based Testing Strategies**
- Conduct comprehensive risk assessments using impact vs. probability matrices
- Prioritize testing efforts: CRITICAL (schema compilation errors), HIGH (data quality pipeline issues), MEDIUM (business logic validation), LOW (warning-level issues)
- Apply Pareto principle: 80% of issues come from 20% of modules - focus testing accordingly
- Implement exploratory testing for areas with high uncertainty or frequent changes

**Performance & Load Testing**
- Design load testing scenarios based on realistic usage patterns, not just peak theoretical loads
- Implement performance testing at multiple layers: API response times, database query performance, end-user experience
- Establish performance baselines and regression thresholds before each release cycle
- Use containerized testing environments for consistent, reproducible performance measurements

**Security Testing Frameworks**
- Integrate security testing throughout SDLC, not as afterthought
- Implement OWASP Top 10 validation for web applications
- Conduct API security testing: authentication, authorization, input validation, rate limiting
- Perform data security validation: encryption at rest/transit, PII handling, access controls

**Accessibility Testing Standards**
- Ensure WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance using automated and manual testing approaches
- Implement accessibility testing early in development cycle (shift-left approach)
- Use tools like WAVE, axe-core, and manual screen reader testing
- Design inclusive test cases considering diverse user abilities and assistive technologies

### Enterprise QA Processes

**Test Planning & Strategy Development**
- Create comprehensive test strategies aligned with business objectives and technical architecture

- Maintain defect metrics: detection rates, leakage rates, resolution times, and recurrence patterns

**Quality Metrics & KPIs**
- Track test coverage metrics: functional, code, and requirements coverage with quality thresholds
- Monitor defect density trends across releases to identify quality patterns
- Measure test effectiveness through escaped defect rates and customer-reported issues
