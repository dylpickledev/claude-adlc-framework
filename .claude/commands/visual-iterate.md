description: Iterative visual development workflow with design comparison and feedback
---

I'll guide you through an iterative visual development process, comparing implementations against designs and providing structured feedback.

## ðŸ”„ **Visual Iteration Workflow**

### Phase 1: Baseline Capture
1. **Current State Screenshot**: Capture what you have now
2. **Design Reference**: Provide mockups, wireframes, or reference designs
3. **Gap Analysis**: I'll identify key differences and priorities

### Phase 2: Implementation Planning
1. **Priority Matrix**: Critical vs. nice-to-have changes
2. **Technical Approach**: How to implement each change
3. **Resource Estimation**: Time/effort for each improvement

### Phase 3: Iterative Development
1. **Implement Changes**: Make targeted improvements
2. **Progress Screenshots**: Capture incremental progress
3. **Course Correction**: Adjust approach based on results

## ðŸŽ¯ **Use Cases**

### Dashboard Design Iteration
- **Tableau Dashboard**: Compare against business requirements
- **KPI Layout**: Optimize information hierarchy
- **Color Schemes**: Ensure accessibility and branding

### Application UI Refinement
- **Data Entry Forms**: Improve user experience flow
- **Navigation Elements**: Enhance usability
- **Responsive Design**: Test across different screen sizes

### Report Layout Optimization
- **PDF Reports**: Improve readability and professional appearance
- **Email Templates**: Optimize for different email clients
- **Print Layouts**: Ensure proper formatting for physical documents

## ðŸ“‹ **Structured Feedback Format**

For each iteration, I'll provide:

### âœ… **What's Working**
- Elements that match design intent
- Good usability patterns
- Effective visual hierarchy

### ðŸ”§ **Areas for Improvement**
- Specific design gaps
- Usability concerns
- Technical implementation issues

### ðŸŽ¯ **Next Steps**
- Prioritized list of changes
- Implementation suggestions
- Success criteria for next iteration

## ðŸ’¡ **Example Workflow**

```
/visual-iterate

Phase 1: "Here's my current dashboard at ~/screenshots/current.png 
and the design mockup at ~/designs/target.png"

Phase 2: Implementation based on feedback

Phase 3: "Updated version at ~/screenshots/iteration2.png - 
how does this look compared to the target?"
```

This implements Claude Code's **visual iteration** best practice with 2-3 cycle optimization.
