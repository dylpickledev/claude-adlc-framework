description: Take and analyze dashboard or application screenshots for development feedback
---

I'll help you take and analyze screenshots for visual development work.

This command is particularly useful for:

## ðŸ“¸ **Screenshot Analysis Workflows**

### Dashboard Development
- Take screenshots of Tableau dashboards
- Compare against design mockups
- Identify visual inconsistencies
- Suggest UI/UX improvements

### Data Application Testing
- Capture application states during development
- Document visual bugs or issues
- Create visual regression tests
- Compare before/after implementations

### Visual Iteration Process
1. **Capture Current State**: Screenshot of current implementation
2. **Analysis**: I'll analyze layout, styling, user experience
3. **Recommendations**: Specific suggestions for improvements
4. **Next Iteration**: Implement changes and capture again

## ðŸ”§ **How to Use**

1. **Take Screenshot**: Use your system's screenshot tool (Cmd+Shift+4 on macOS)
2. **Provide Path**: Give me the path to the screenshot file
3. **Context**: Tell me what you're working on and what feedback you need
4. **Analysis**: I'll provide detailed visual analysis and suggestions

## ðŸ’¡ **Example Usage**

```
/screenshot
"I just took a screenshot of our new sales dashboard at ~/Desktop/dashboard.png. 
Can you analyze the layout and suggest improvements for better user experience?"
```

This aligns with Claude Code's **visual iteration** best practice for UI/UX development.
