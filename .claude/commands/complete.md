```

---

## Analysis Phase

### DEFAULT MODE: Steps 1-1.5 (Core Analysis)

#### Step 1: Project Analysis & Knowledge Extraction

**Claude analyzes completed project for:**
- **Technical Documentation**: Architecture patterns, implementation strategies
- **Agent Knowledge**: Tool-specific learnings and best practices
- **Process Insights**: Workflow improvements and organizational patterns
- **Integration Patterns**: Cross-system coordination strategies

**Actions**:
1. **Read project files**: `spec.md`, `context.md`, `tasks/`, `README.md`
2. **Identify extractable knowledge**:
   - Architecture patterns and technical decisions
   - Tool-specific insights for specialist agents
   - Process improvements and workflow learnings
   - Integration strategies and coordination patterns

---

#### Step 1.5: Basic Performance Metrics

**Track essential metrics for knowledge extraction:**

- **Agent invocations**: Count by type (dbt-expert: 3, snowflake-expert: 2, etc.)
- **Success patterns**: Completed without retries vs total attempts
- **Key learnings**: What worked, what patterns emerged
- **Confidence updates**: Which agent patterns validated (+0.05 to +0.15)

---

### DEEP MODE ONLY (`--deep` flag): Steps 1.6-1.9 (ACE Analysis)

**Note**: The following analysis steps are ONLY executed when user runs `/complete [project] --deep`

---

#### Step 1.6: Delegation Effectiveness Deep-Dive

**Quantitative + qualitative analysis of agent delegation decisions:**

For each specialist agent invoked:
- Assess value delivered vs token cost
- Evaluate delegation necessity (necessary/marginal/unnecessary)
- Validate 0.60 confidence threshold effectiveness
- Calculate ROI (business impact / token cost)

**Outputs**:
- Delegation necessity breakdown (% necessary vs marginal)
- Token cost vs value analysis
- Threshold optimization recommendations

---

#### Step 1.7: Project Execution Reflection (ACE Learning)

**Systematic analysis of what worked, what failed, and why:**

**Key reflection areas**:
1. **Approach Effectiveness**: What patterns worked (rank by effectiveness)
2. **Error Patterns**: What errors occurred, root causes, resolutions
3. **Skill Performance**: If skills used, did they deliver expected outcomes?
4. **Decision Quality**: Were major technical decisions validated?
5. **Knowledge Gaps**: What information was missing that slowed progress?

**Critical ACE questions**:
- What would you do differently if starting this project again?
- Were there alternative approaches? Which was chosen and why?
- What approaches didn't work or were inefficient?

**Outputs**:
- Ranked list of effective approaches with reuse guidance
- Error pattern documentation (error ‚Üí resolution ‚Üí prevention)
- Knowledge gap identification for agent updates
- Decision validation (what worked, what needs refinement)

---

#### Step 1.8: Skill Discovery Analysis (Automation Opportunities)

**Identify repetitive workflows worth automating:**

**Analysis process**:
1. Review project files for procedural patterns ("Step A ‚Üí Step B ‚Üí Step C")
2. Count repetitions: How many times executed in this + past projects?
3. Score automation value (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
4. Extract reusable templates (documents, code, config)

**Scoring criteria**:
- **HIGH VALUE**: 3+ occurrences, 15+ min each, clear reusable pattern ‚Üí Propose skill
- **MEDIUM VALUE**: 2-3 occurrences, 10-15 min each ‚Üí Track as candidate
- **LOW VALUE**: 1-2 occurrences, <10 min each ‚Üí Skip

**Outputs**:
- Workflow frequency table (this project + historical)
- HIGH VALUE skill candidates with time savings calculations
- Extracted templates ready for skill creation

---

#### Step 1.9: Knowledge Dissemination Strategy

**Determine optimal knowledge placement and updates:**

**Claude analyzes**:
- Which agent files need updates (tool-specific insights)
- Whether new patterns warrant pattern library additions
- If application knowledge requires three-tier documentation
- Configuration quality (follows Anthropic best practices)

**Present unified proposal to user** with all recommended changes:

```markdown
üîç Analyzing project: [project-name]

ü§î **Should I proceed with these knowledge updates?**
   - Type 'yes' to execute all proposed changes
   - Type 'modify' to adjust specific updates
   - Type 'skip' to complete project without knowledge updates
```

---

## Approval Phase

### WAIT for User Approval

User options:
- **yes**: Execute all proposed changes
- **modify**: Adjust specific updates (Claude asks which to modify)
- **skip**: Complete project without knowledge updates

---

## Execution Phase: Steps 2-5

### Step 2: Execute Approved Knowledge Updates

**Only after user approval, Claude executes:**

#### 2.1 Agent Knowledge Updates

Update agent files with:
- Tool-specific insights and best practices
- Confidence score adjustments based on outcomes
- Integration patterns and coordination strategies
- Performance metrics updates

**For each agent file updated**:
- Add new pattern sections with evidence
- Update confidence scores with validation counts
- Add contextual guidance (when to use, when to avoid)
- Update routing recommendations

#### 2.2 Technical Documentation

**Production Application Knowledge** ‚Üí `knowledge/applications/<app-name>/`:
- **When**: Deploying new apps or major app updates
- **Structure**: Three-tier pattern (Tier 2 - comprehensive docs)
  - `architecture/` - System design, data flows, infrastructure details
  - `deployment/` - Complete deployment runbooks, Docker builds, AWS configuration
  - `operations/` - Monitoring, troubleshooting guides, incident response
- **Updates Required**:
  1. Create/update knowledge base docs for the application
  2. Update agent pattern index (e.g., aws-expert.md with confidence scores)
  3. Add to "Known Applications" in relevant role agents
  4. Create lightweight README in actual repo (Tier 1) linking to knowledge base

**Platform/Tool Patterns** ‚Üí `knowledge/da-agent-hub/`:
- **When**: Discovering reusable patterns for ADLC workflow
- **Structure**: Organized by ADLC phase (planning/, development/, operations/)
- **Examples**: Testing frameworks, git workflows, cross-system analysis patterns

#### 2.3 Pattern Library Updates

- Create new patterns based on project learnings
- Update existing patterns with new validations and confidence scores
- Add contextual guidance to patterns (when to use, when to avoid)
- Deprecate superseded patterns with links to better approaches

#### 2.4 Skill Creation (If Proposed)

If HIGH VALUE skill candidates identified:
- Create `.claude/skills/[skill-name]/skill.md` with workflow
- Add templates to `.claude/skills/[skill-name]/templates/`
- Update `.claude/skills/README.md` catalog
- Document trigger phrases and expected outcomes

#### 2.5 Memory System Updates

**Note**: Pattern extraction happens automatically via `finish.sh`:
- Extracts patterns marked with PATTERN:, SOLUTION:, ERROR-FIX:, etc.
- Saves to `.claude/memory/recent/YYYY-MM.md`
- No manual action needed - automatic during archival

---

### Step 3: Archive Project

1. **Create archive directory**: `projects/completed/YYYY-MM/[project-name]/`
2. **Move project files**: Complete project structure with full history
3. **Remove from active**: Clean up `projects/active/[project-name]/`
4. **Execute finish.sh**: Automatic pattern extraction, GitHub issue closure, worktree cleanup

---

### Step 4: Git Workflow Guidance

**Provide branch-aware options:**
- **Feature branch**: Recommend PR creation for review
- **Main branch**: Confirm direct merge readiness
- **Stay on branch**: Option to continue working

**Git workflow commands**:
```bash
# Create PR (recommended for feature branches)
gh pr create --title "Complete [project-name]" --body "[description]"

# Or merge to main
git checkout main && git merge [branch]
```

---

### Step 5: Handle Related Ideas

- **Search for source ideas**: Look for original idea that led to this project
- **Handle based on what's found**:
  - **If source idea exists**: Move to archive and update with completion status
  - **If no source idea**: Note as ad-hoc project (no idea cleanup needed)
  - **If orphaned ideas found**: Clean up any related unarchived ideas
- **Cross-reference completion**: Maintain idea ‚Üí project ‚Üí completion traceability
- **Clean up workflow**: Ensure no orphaned ideas remain
