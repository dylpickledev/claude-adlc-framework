# /complete Command Protocol

## Purpose
Complete and archive projects with automated knowledge extraction, performance metrics tracking, and intelligent knowledge dissemination. Implements prompt-first ADLC project completion with intelligent knowledge preservation.

## Usage
```bash
claude /complete [project-name]
```

## Protocol

### 1. Project Analysis & Knowledge Extraction
**Claude analyzes completed project for:**
- **Technical Documentation**: Architecture patterns, implementation strategies
- **Agent Knowledge**: Tool-specific learnings and best practices
- **Process Insights**: Workflow improvements and organizational patterns
- **Integration Patterns**: Cross-system coordination strategies
- **Performance Metrics**: Agent effectiveness and routing intelligence

### 2. Automated Knowledge Dissemination
**Before archiving, Claude automatically:**
- **Extracts key patterns** from project specifications and findings
- **Updates agent knowledge bases** with tool-specific insights
- **Tracks performance metrics** for continuous improvement
- **Updates confidence scores** based on project outcomes
- **Preserves technical documentation** in knowledge directory
- **Creates cross-references** for future project reference

### 3. Complete Project Archival
- **Archives project**: Moves to `projects/completed/YYYY-MM/[project-name]/`
- **Extracts patterns**: Auto-populates memory system via finish.sh
- **Git workflow guidance**: Provides PR creation and merge options
- **Updates related ideas**: Links completion back to original archived ideas
- **Enables operations**: Project ready for ADLC Operate phase monitoring

## Claude Instructions

When user runs `/complete [project-name]`:

### Step 1: Analyze Project and Propose Knowledge Changes
1. **Read project files**: spec.md, context.md, tasks/, README.md
2. **Identify extractable knowledge**:
   - Architecture patterns and technical decisions
   - Tool-specific insights for specialist agents
   - Process improvements and workflow learnings
   - Integration strategies and coordination patterns

3. **Present proposed changes BEFORE making them**:
   - List specific agent files to update with exact content additions
   - Identify new knowledge documents to create
   - Show proposed updates to README.md or CLAUDE.md if relevant
   - Request explicit approval: "Should I proceed with these knowledge updates?"

4. **WAIT for user approval** before making any changes

### Step 1.5: Extract Performance Metrics
**Track quantitative data for continuous improvement:**

1. **Agent invocation patterns**:
   - Count agent invocations by type (dbt-expert: 3, snowflake-expert: 2, etc.)
   - Document success/retry patterns for each agent
   - Measure estimated execution times

2. **Performance indicators**:
   - Success rate (completed without retries vs total attempts)
   - Task complexity indicators (simple query vs complex transformation)
   - Cross-agent coordination effectiveness

3. **Failure pattern documentation**:
   - Common error types encountered
   - Retry scenarios and resolution methods
   - Knowledge gaps identified during execution

4. **Confidence score updates**:
   - Identify successful patterns that should increase agent confidence
   - Document areas where agents struggled (decrease confidence)
   - Calculate confidence adjustments based on task outcomes

### Step 2: Execute Approved Knowledge Updates (Only After Approval)
**Check for updates to:**

#### Agent Knowledge (`/.claude/agents/`)
- **dbt-expert.md**: SQL patterns, model architectures, testing strategies + confidence updates
- **snowflake-expert.md**: Query optimization, cost management patterns + confidence updates
- **tableau-expert.md**: Dashboard design patterns, visualization strategies + confidence updates
- **da-architect.md**: System design patterns, data flow architectures + confidence updates
- **documentation-expert.md**: Documentation standards and templates + confidence updates
- **business-context.md**: Stakeholder management and requirement patterns + confidence updates
- **[other-agents].md**: Tool-specific insights and best practices + confidence updates

**Confidence Score Management:**
- Update agent confidence levels based on project outcomes
- Document successful patterns that warrant confidence increases (+0.05 to +0.15)
- Identify knowledge gaps that suggest confidence decreases (-0.05 to -0.10)
- Create routing recommendations for future similar tasks

#### Technical Documentation (`/knowledge/`)
- **Architecture patterns**: System design and integration strategies
- **Process documentation**: Workflow improvements and organizational methods
- **Technical guides**: Implementation patterns and troubleshooting
- **Team documentation**: Standards and collaborative practices

#### Memory System Updates (`/.claude/memory/`)
**Note**: Pattern extraction happens automatically via `finish.sh`:
- Extracts patterns marked with PATTERN:, SOLUTION:, ERROR-FIX:, etc.
- Saves to `.claude/memory/recent/YYYY-MM.md`
- No manual action needed - automatic during archival

### Step 3: Archive Project
1. **Create archive directory**: `projects/completed/YYYY-MM/[project-name]/`
2. **Move project files**: Complete project structure with full history
3. **Remove from active**: Clean up `projects/active/[project-name]/`

### Step 4: Git Workflow Guidance
**Provide branch-aware options:**
- **Feature branch**: Recommend PR creation for review
- **Main branch**: Confirm direct merge readiness
- **Stay on branch**: Option to continue working

### Step 5: Handle Related Ideas (If Any)
- **Search for source ideas**: Look for original idea that led to this project
- **Handle based on what's found**:
  - **If source idea exists**: Move to archive and update with completion status
  - **If no source idea**: Note as ad-hoc project (no idea cleanup needed)
  - **If orphaned ideas found**: Clean up any related unarchived ideas
- **Cross-reference completion**: Maintain idea ‚Üí project ‚Üí completion traceability when applicable
- **Clean up workflow**: Ensure no orphaned ideas remain in inbox/organized
