# Role-Based Agent Migration Guide

## Overview

The DA Agent Hub has migrated from tool-specific agents to role-based agents that better reflect how analytics teams actually work. This guide explains the changes and how to work with the new structure.

## What Changed

### Before: Tool-Specific Agents (17 agents, high coordination overhead)
```
dbt-expert → snowflake-expert → tableau-expert → back to dbt-expert
(Multiple handoffs for a single optimization task)
```

### After: Role-Based Agents (7 primary roles, 80% fewer handoffs)
```
analytics-engineer-role handles entire optimization cycle
(Single agent owns transformation layer end-to-end)
```

## The New Role-Based Structure

### Primary Agents (Use These First)

#### 1. **analytics-engineer-role**
**When to use**: Anything involving data transformation, modeling, or SQL optimization
- ✅ Creating dbt models and marts
- ✅ Optimizing query performance
- ✅ Implementing business logic and metrics
- ✅ Data quality testing
- ✅ Semantic layer development

**Replaces**: dbt-expert + snowflake-expert (SQL aspects) + tableau-expert (data layer)

**Example**:
```
OLD: "Ask dbt-expert to optimize the model, then snowflake-expert for warehouse tuning"
NEW: "analytics-engineer-role, optimize this slow model"
```

#### 2. **data-engineer-role**
**When to use**: Anything involving data pipelines, ingestion, or orchestration
- ✅ Setting up source integrations (batch OR streaming)
- ✅ Configuring Orchestra workflows
- ✅ Building dlthub or Prefect pipelines
- ✅ Troubleshooting pipeline failures
- ✅ Data quality at ingestion

**Replaces**: dlthub-expert + orchestra-expert + prefect-expert

**Example**:
```
OLD: "Should I use dlthub-expert or prefect-expert for this pipeline?"
NEW: "data-engineer-role, set up ingestion from Salesforce"
     (They choose the right tool based on requirements)
```

#### 3. **bi-developer-role**
**When to use**: Anything involving enterprise BI tools (Tableau, Power BI)
- ✅ Creating Tableau/Power BI dashboards
- ✅ Optimizing BI tool performance
- ✅ Executive reporting and analytics
- ✅ Self-service BI enablement
- ✅ Business user training and documentation

**Replaces**: tableau-expert (visualization) + documentation-expert (BI user docs)

#### 4. **ui-ux-developer-role**
**When to use**: Anything involving web applications and custom tools
- ✅ Building Streamlit data applications
- ✅ Creating React-based interfaces
- ✅ User experience design for web apps
- ✅ Interactive prototypes and admin tools
- ✅ Application performance optimization

**Replaces**: streamlit-expert + react-expert + ui-ux-expert

**Examples**:
```
# BI Dashboards
OLD: "tableau-expert create dashboard, then documentation-expert for guide"
NEW: "bi-developer-role, create an executive sales dashboard with training materials"

# Web Applications
OLD: "streamlit-expert create admin tool, then ui-ux-expert for design"
NEW: "ui-ux-developer-role, create dbt metadata admin tool"
```

#### 5. **data-architect-role**
**When to use**: Strategic decisions, system design, architectural patterns
- ✅ Technology selection and evaluation
- ✅ System integration patterns
- ✅ Platform roadmap and strategy
- ✅ Governance and standards

**Was**: da-architect (renamed for consistency)

#### 6. **business-analyst-role**
**When to use**: Requirements gathering, stakeholder management, business logic
- ✅ Translating business needs to technical requirements
- ✅ Metric definitions and validation
- ✅ Stakeholder communication
- ✅ Business logic clarification

**Was**: business-context (renamed for consistency)

#### 7. **qa-engineer-role**
**When to use**: Testing strategy, data quality validation, comprehensive QA
- ✅ Test framework design
- ✅ Data quality validation
- ✅ System integration testing
- ✅ UAT coordination

**Was**: qa-coordinator (renamed for consistency)

#### 8. **project-manager-role**
**When to use**: Project planning, delivery coordination, stakeholder management
- ✅ Project planning and milestones
- ✅ UAT frameworks
- ✅ Stakeholder coordination
- ✅ Risk management

**Was**: project-delivery-expert (renamed for consistency)

### Tool Specialists (Consultation Layer)

The old tool-specific agents still exist but are now used as **specialist consultants** (20% of cases):

- **dbt-expert**: Complex macro development, package creation
- **snowflake-expert**: Deep warehouse optimization, cost anomalies
- **tableau-expert**: Advanced Tableau features, complex calculations
- **streamlit-expert**: Complex Streamlit patterns, advanced caching
- **react-expert**: Advanced React patterns, complex state management
- **dlthub-expert**: Complex CDC scenarios, custom extractors
- **orchestra-expert**: Advanced orchestration patterns
- **prefect-expert**: Complex flow patterns, advanced features
- **documentation-expert**: Platform-wide documentation standards

**When role agents consult specialists**:
```python
# Analytics engineer handles most SQL optimization
analytics-engineer-role: "I can optimize this model, but the macro logic is complex"
→ Consults dbt-expert for advanced macro patterns
→ Implements solution with expert guidance
```

## How to Use the New System

### Decision Tree: Which Agent to Use?

```
Is it about data transformation, modeling, or SQL?
  → analytics-engineer-role

Is it about data pipelines, ingestion, or orchestration?
  → data-engineer-role

Is it about BI dashboards or reports (Tableau/Power BI)?
  → bi-developer-role

Is it about web applications or custom tools (Streamlit/React)?
  → ui-ux-developer-role

Is it about system architecture or strategic decisions?
  → data-architect-role

Is it about business requirements or stakeholder management?
  → business-analyst-role

Is it about testing or quality assurance?
  → qa-engineer-role

Is it about project delivery or coordination?
  → project-manager-role

Is it a complex tool-specific edge case?
  → Start with role agent, they'll consult specialist if needed
```

### Example Workflows

#### Example 1: Slow Dashboard Performance
**Old Workflow** (6 agents, 3 hours):
1. tableau-expert: "Dashboard is slow"
2. → dbt-expert: "Let me check the model"
3. → snowflake-expert: "Let me optimize the query"
4. → dbt-expert: "I'll update the model"
5. → tableau-expert: "I'll adjust the extract"
6. → documentation-expert: "I'll document the changes"

**New Workflow** (2 agents, 1 hour):
1. bi-developer-role: "Dashboard is slow, let me investigate"
   - Analyzes Tableau performance
   - Coordinates with analytics-engineer-role for upstream optimization
   - Implements dashboard fixes
   - Updates documentation
2. → analytics-engineer-role (if needed): Optimizes data model

#### Example 2: New Data Source Integration
**Old Workflow** (5 agents, 4 hours):
1. "Should I use dlthub-expert or prefect-expert?"
2. dlthub-expert: "Set up extraction"
3. → orchestra-expert: "Schedule the pipeline"
4. → dbt-expert: "Create staging models"
5. → documentation-expert: "Document the source"

**New Workflow** (2 agents, 2 hours):
1. data-engineer-role:
   - Chooses right tool (dlthub for batch, Prefect for streaming)
   - Sets up extraction
   - Configures Orchestra orchestration
   - Hands off clean staging data
2. → analytics-engineer-role: Creates transformation models

#### Example 3: New Metric Implementation
**Old Workflow** (4 agents, 3 hours):
1. business-context: "What's the business definition?"
2. → dbt-expert: "Build the metric logic"
3. → snowflake-expert: "Optimize the calculation"
4. → tableau-expert: "Add to dashboards"

**New Workflow** (3 agents, 1.5 hours):
1. business-analyst-role: Clarifies metric definition
2. → analytics-engineer-role: Implements in dbt with optimization
3. → bi-developer-role: Adds to relevant dashboards

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: What happens to my existing workflows that call tool-specific agents?
**A**: They still work! Tool specialists exist as a consultation layer. Role agents will automatically consult them when needed.

### Q: Can I still use dbt-expert directly?
**A**: Yes, but try analytics-engineer-role first. They'll consult dbt-expert if the task requires deep tool expertise.

### Q: How do I know when to use a role vs a specialist?
**A**: Always start with roles. They handle 80% of tasks independently and consult specialists for the complex 20%.

### Q: What if a role agent doesn't know something?
**A**: They'll explicitly consult the relevant specialist and combine insights for you.

### Q: Will this affect my existing projects?
**A**: No. This is a change in how agents are organized, not in functionality. All capabilities remain available.

### Q: How do I give feedback on the new structure?
**A**: Include feedback in project completion notes or reach out directly. We're tracking effectiveness metrics.

## Success Metrics

We're tracking these metrics to validate the migration:

- **Task Completion Time**: Target 40% reduction
- **Agent Handoffs**: Target 50% reduction
- **User Satisfaction**: Target >4/5 rating
- **Independent Task Handling**: Target 80% by role agents (20% specialist consultation)

## Rollback Plan

If the role-based approach doesn't work:
1. Tool specialists remain fully functional
2. Can revert to tool-specific as primary in <1 hour
3. No data or functionality loss
4. Continuous monitoring for first 30 days
