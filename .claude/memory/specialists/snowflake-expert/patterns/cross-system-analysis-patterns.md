# Cross-System Issue Analysis & Coordination Patterns

## Common Issue Categories (Multi-Tool)

### 1. Schema/Column Reference Errors
**Symptom**: Tests referencing incorrect column names vs actual model schemas

**Analysis Pattern**:
- Check dbt model schemas against test definitions
- Verify column name case sensitivity
- Look for renamed columns in recent changes
- Cross-reference with source system schemas

**Priority**: CRITICAL if blocking compilation

### 2. Data Quality Issues
**Symptom**: Uniqueness constraint violations, null constraint failures, massive duplications

**Analysis Pattern**:
- Check upstream data sources for quality
- Review recent ETL/ELT pipeline changes
- Validate data freshness and completeness
- Look for source system changes

**Priority**: HIGH if indicating upstream pipeline problems

### 3. Cross-System Validation Failures
**Symptom**: Mismatches between source systems and dbt model expectations

**Analysis Pattern**:
- Compare source schema with dbt expectations
- Check for API/integration changes
- Validate data type mismatches
- Review ingestion pipeline logs

**Priority**: MEDIUM to HIGH depending on impact

### 4. Business Logic Validation
**Symptom**: Failed reconciliation tests, metric validation errors

**Analysis Pattern**:
- Review business rules implementation
- Validate calculation logic
- Check for edge cases in data
- Consult stakeholders on expectations

**Priority**: MEDIUM unless affecting critical reports

## Architecture-Aware Analysis Approach

### Data Flow Context
Issues often span multiple layers in the data stack:

```
Orchestra (Orchestrator)
    ↓
[Prefect, dbt, Airbyte, Snowflake] (Execution Layer)
    ↓
Snowflake (Data Warehouse)
    ↓
Semantic Layer (Business Logic)
    ↓
Tableau (Visualization)
```

### Orchestra-Centric Thinking
**PATTERN**: Orchestra kicks off everything
- Prefect flows
- dbt jobs
- Airbyte syncs
- Direct Snowflake operations

**Analysis Strategy**:
1. Start with Orchestra logs to understand what triggered
2. Trace execution through triggered systems
3. Identify failure point in the chain
4. Work backwards to root cause

### Model Layer Impact
**PATTERN**: Problems cascade through layers

```
Source System Issue
    ↓
stg_* (Staging Models) - First failure point
    ↓
dm_* (Data Marts) - Downstream failures
    ↓
rpt_* (Reports) - User-facing impact
```

**Analysis Strategy**:
- Start at earliest failure point (usually staging)
- Understand cascade effects downstream
- Fix root cause, not symptoms
- Validate entire chain after fix

### Source System Dependencies
**PATTERN**: Different source systems create different data patterns

**ERP Systems**:
- Structured, transactional data
- Strong referential integrity expected
- Frequent schema changes with updates

**Customer Systems**:
- Variable data quality
- Missing/inconsistent data common
- Requires robust null handling

**Operations Systems**:
- Real-time data with lag considerations
- High volume, time-series patterns
- Deduplication often needed

**Safety Systems**:
- Regulatory compliance requirements
- Strict data retention rules
- Audit trail critical

**Tableau Data Pipeline**:
- Parse TFL flows for published extracts
- Parse TWB workbooks to validate connections
- Trace data flow issues through XML/JSON analysis
- Validate extract refresh schedules

## Cross-Tool Prioritization Framework

### CRITICAL Priority
**Schema compilation errors that block other work**

**Lead Agent**: dbt-expert

**Response Pattern**:
1. Drop everything and address immediately
2. Identify blocking compilation issues
3. Fix schema problems first
4. Validate compilation succeeds
5. Then move to data quality

### HIGH Priority
**Large-scale data quality issues indicating upstream pipeline problems**

**Lead Agents**: orchestra-expert + dlthub-expert

**Response Pattern**:
1. Check Orchestra logs for pipeline status
2. Validate source data quality with dlthub
3. Identify if pipeline or source issue
4. Coordinate fix across systems
5. Re-run pipeline to validate

### MEDIUM Priority
**Business logic and validation failures**

**Lead Agents**: dbt-expert + business-context

**Response Pattern**:
1. Review business requirements
2. Validate logic implementation
3. Check for edge cases
4. Test with sample data
5. Update tests if requirements changed

### LOW Priority
**Warning-level issues that don't break functionality**

**Response Pattern**:
1. Document for future sprint
2. Create backlog item
3. Monitor for pattern escalation
4. Address during refactoring

    dbt-expert      snowflake-expert   tableau-expert
    (check models)  (check queries)    (check dashboards)
        |                 |                 |
        +-----------------+-----------------+
                          |

    ↓
dbt-expert (implement logic)
    ↓
qa-coordinator (test functionality)
    ↓
business-context (validate with stakeholders)
    ↓ (if changes needed)
dbt-expert (refine implementation)
```
