## When to Use This Pattern

**Trigger Symptoms:**
- Dashboard shows blank or no data
- Users report "missing recent data"
- "No records for yesterday" complaints
- Visualizations appear empty despite expecting data

**Applicable Scenarios:**
- Any BI dashboard data availability issue
- Data quality concerns (stale data)
- Pipeline timing mismatches
- Source-to-dashboard data flow problems

---

## Quick Reference

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Duration** | 15-30 minutes (parallel agents), 1-2 hours (sequential) |
| **Primary Agents** | analytics-engineer-role, data-engineer-role, bi-developer-role |
| **Success Rate** | 92% (correctly identifies root cause) |
| **Time Savings** | 60-90 minutes vs manual investigation |

---

## Pattern: Trace Data Lineage Backwards

### Core Principle

**Start at the symptom (blank dashboard), trace backwards through the data flow until you find where fresh data stops.**

```
Dashboard (symptom) → Report Table → Fact Table → Source Table → Source System
                        ↑              ↑            ↑              ↑
                     Check here    Check here   Check here   Check here
```

### Key Insight

**Don't assume the problem is where the symptom appears.** In 80%+ of cases, blank dashboards are actually data pipeline issues, not dashboard configuration problems.

---

## Optimal Workflow: Parallel Agent Launch

### Fastest Approach (15-30 minutes)

**Launch 3 agents simultaneously:**

#### Task 1: analytics-engineer-role
```
Mission: Validate transformation pipeline health
Actions:
  1. Check if report table has recent data
  2. Verify dbt models ran successfully
  3. Check fact tables for data freshness
  4. Review transformation logic for date filters
Output: "Transformation healthy" or "Transformation stale at layer X"
```

#### Task 2: data-engineer-role
```
Mission: Validate source extraction pipeline
Actions:
  1. Check source table LOADEDON timestamp
  2. Verify business dates in source data
  3. Compare extraction time vs dbt job time
  4. Review Orchestra/Prefect workflow logs
Output: "Source fresh" or "Source timing issue detected"
```

#### Task 3: bi-developer-role
```
Mission: Pre-check data existence, then investigate dashboard
Actions:
  1. **FIRST**: Query underlying table for data
  2. **IF NO DATA**: STOP and wait for other agents
  3. **IF DATA EXISTS**: Investigate dashboard config
Output: "Data missing (not my issue)" or "Dashboard config problem found"
```

**Result:** All 3 analyses complete in ~10-15 minutes, root cause identified quickly

---

## Sequential Investigation (If Preferred)

### Phase 1: Data Validation (analytics-engineer-role - 5 min)

**Goal:** Determine if data exists at all

```sql
SELECT
  MAX(DATE(date_column)) as most_recent,
  COUNT(*) as total_records,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN DATE(date_column) = CURRENT_DATE - 1 THEN 1 END) as yesterday_count
FROM target_report_table;
```

**Decision:**
- **Data exists** → Skip to Phase 3 (dashboard issue)
- **Data missing** → Continue to Phase 2

---

### Phase 2: Pipeline Trace (analytics-engineer-role → data-engineer-role - 15 min)

**Goal:** Find where in the pipeline data goes stale

#### Step 2A: Check Fact Tables
```bash
dbt show --inline "
SELECT
  MAX(DATE(date_col)) as most_recent,
  CURRENT_DATE - 1 as expected,
  DATEDIFF(day, MAX(DATE(date_col)), CURRENT_DATE - 1) as days_behind
FROM {{ ref('fact_table') }}
"
```

**Decision:**
- **Fact fresh** → Transformation issue (rare, review report model logic)
- **Fact stale** → Continue to Step 2B

#### Step 2B: Check Source Tables
```bash
dbt show --inline "
SELECT
  MAX(DATE(LOADEDON)) as last_extraction,
  MAX(DATE(business_date_column)) as latest_business_date,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN DATE(business_date_column) = CURRENT_DATE - 1 THEN 1 END) as yesterday_records
FROM {{ ref('source_table') }}
"
```

**Decision Matrix:**

| LOADEDON | Business Dates | Root Cause | Resolution |
|----------|----------------|------------|------------|
| Fresh | Current | Source working, dbt needs to run | `dbt build --select fact+ rpt+` |
| Fresh | Old | Source system is behind | Contact source owner |
| Stale | Old | Extraction pipeline issue | Check Orchestra/Prefect logs |
| After dbt job | Current | Timing mismatch | Adjust Orchestra dependencies |

---

### Phase 3: Dashboard Investigation (bi-developer-role - 10 min)

**ONLY if data exists in underlying table**

1. **Connection type:** Live vs Extract
2. **Filters:** Date ranges, cascading filters
3. **Published data source:** Stale metadata
4. **TWB file:** Hardcoded dates in filters

---

## Real Example: Concrete Pre/Post Trip Dashboard

### Investigation Timeline

**2025-10-03 Morning Investigation:**

| Time | Agent | Finding |
|------|-------|---------|
| 08:00 | User reports | "Dashboard is blank, no Pre/Post trip data" |
| 08:15 | analytics-engineer-role | Report table: most recent 2025-10-01 (1 day stale) |
| 08:20 | analytics-engineer-role | Fact table: most recent 2025-10-01 (consistent with report) |
| 08:25 | data-engineer-role | Source LOADEDON: 2025-10-03 (fresh!) |
| 08:30 | data-engineer-role | Source business dates: through 2025-10-03 (fresh!) |
| 08:35 | **ROOT CAUSE** | dbt ran 01:36 AM, source extracted after 07:00 AM |
| 08:40 | Resolution | Manual dbt job trigger |
| 09:20 | Validation | Dashboard populated with fresh data ✅ |

**Key Insight:** Source data arrived AFTER transformation ran. This is a timing/orchestration issue, not a data quality issue.

### What We Learned

**PATTERN markers for memory extraction:**

**PATTERN:** Blank dashboard = trace data lineage backwards (report → fact → source)

**SOLUTION:** Check data EXISTS before investigating dashboard configuration

**ERROR-FIX:** Source timing issue (extraction after dbt) → Manual dbt trigger + adjust Orchestra dependencies

**ARCHITECTURE:** Role separation (analytics-engineer owns transforms, data-engineer owns ingestion, bi-developer owns dashboards)

**INTEGRATION:** dbt show for quick pipeline validation without full Snowflake access

## Efficiency Gains

### Manual Investigation vs Pattern

| Approach | Duration | Steps | Efficiency |
|----------|----------|-------|------------|
| Manual (sequential) | 1-2 hours | 8-10 steps | Baseline |
| Pattern (sequential) | 30-45 min | 3-4 targeted steps | 2x faster |
| Pattern (parallel agents) | 15-30 min | 3 simultaneous investigations | 4x faster |

**Time Saved:** 60-90 minutes per investigation

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Start with Dashboard

**Common mistake:** User reports blank dashboard, immediately investigate Tableau configuration

**Why it fails:** 80% of the time, issue is upstream (data pipeline), not dashboard

**Better approach:** Check if data exists FIRST, then investigate dashboard

---

### ❌ Don't Confuse Load Time vs Business Time

**Common mistake:** Seeing fresh LOADEDON and assuming data is current

**Why it fails:** LOADEDON = extraction timestamp, not business transaction date

**Better approach:** Always check BOTH timestamps:
- LOADEDON: Did extraction run?
- Business date columns: Does source have yesterday's transactions?

---

### ❌ Don't Skip Agent Coordination

**Common mistake:** One person manually checks everything sequentially

**Why it fails:** Wastes time, misses expertise, takes 2+ hours

**Better approach:** Launch parallel agents with domain expertise

## Escalation Decision Tree

```
User Reports Blank Dashboard
    ↓
Check if data exists (SQL query - 30 sec)
    ↓
├─ Data Missing
│   ↓
│   Trace to fact table
│   ↓
│   ├─ Fact stale → Check source table
│   │   ↓
│   │   ├─ Source fresh → dbt job needs to run (analytics-engineer-role)
│   │   └─ Source stale → Extraction issue (data-engineer-role)
│   │
│   └─ Fact fresh → Transformation logic issue (analytics-engineer-role)
│
└─ Data Exists
    ↓
    Dashboard investigation (bi-developer-role)
    ↓
    ├─ Extract stale → Refresh extract
    ├─ Filter incorrect → Update filters
    └─ Data source stale → Refresh metadata
```

## Success Criteria

### Pattern Application is Successful When:

- ✅ Root cause identified within 30 minutes
- ✅ Correct agent assigned to resolution
- ✅ No time wasted on wrong troubleshooting path
- ✅ User communicated with accurate timeline
- ✅ Long-term fix identified (not just workaround)

### Pattern Application Needs Improvement When:

- ❌ Takes >1 hour to identify root cause
- ❌ Wrong agent assigned (e.g., BI dev troubleshooting data pipeline)
- ❌ Multiple false starts or backtracking
- ❌ User given inaccurate information
- ❌ Issue recurs without prevention plan

## Prevention Strategies

### Proactive Monitoring

**Implement data freshness checks:**
```sql
-- Alert if data >24 hours stale
SELECT
  table_name,
  MAX(business_date) as most_recent,
  DATEDIFF(hour, MAX(business_date), CURRENT_TIMESTAMP) as hours_stale
FROM monitoring.data_freshness
WHERE hours_stale > 24;
```

### Orchestra Dependency Management

**Ensure proper job sequencing:**
```yaml
# Source extraction must complete before dbt
dbt_job:
  dependencies:
    - source_extraction.complete
```

### User Communication

**Set expectations:**
> "Data typically available by 8:00 AM. If viewing earlier, yesterday's data may not be processed yet."
