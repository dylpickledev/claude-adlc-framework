## MCP Server Roadmap

### Currently Out of Scope
The following MCP servers have been temporarily moved out of scope to ensure a stable initial release. They are documented here for future implementation.

#### ClickUp Integration
- **Status**: Custom Node.js server requires additional setup complexity
- **Challenges**: 
  - Build process dependencies (Node.js, npm)
  - Environment configuration complexity
  - Authentication flow setup
- **Future Implementation**:
  - Consider packaging as uvx-compatible Python wrapper
  - Simplify authentication mechanism
  - Add automated build process to CI/CD

#### Tableau Server Integration
- **Status**: Waiting for official tableau-mcp package
- **Current Workaround**: Manual tableau-server-client usage
- **Dependencies**: 
  - uvx package: `tableau-mcp` (not yet available)
  - Tableau Server API credentials
- **Future Implementation**:
  - Monitor for official tableau-mcp package release
  - Implement dashboard analysis and optimization tools
  - Add performance monitoring capabilities

#### Orchestra Workflow Integration
- **Status**: Waiting for official orchestra-mcp package  
- **Current Workaround**: REST API calls via custom scripts
- **Dependencies**:
  - uvx package: `orchestra-mcp` (not yet available)
  - Orchestra API access and credentials
- **Future Implementation**:
  - Pipeline monitoring and debugging
  - Automated workflow management
  - Integration with dbt model dependencies

## Additional Planned Features

### Enhanced Agent Capabilities
- **Multi-Repository Support**: Better handling of multiple dbt projects
