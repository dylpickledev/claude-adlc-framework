# da-agent-hub Spec-Driven Development Workflow Demo

This document demonstrates the enhanced workflow capabilities inspired by GitHub's spec-kit.

## Workflow Overview

The enhanced da-agent-hub now supports structured, specification-driven development for complex data analytics projects using three primary commands:

1. **`/specify`** - Create specification and feature branch
2. **`/plan`** - Generate implementation plan with tool coordination  
3. **`/tasks`** - Break down into executable tasks with sub-agent assignments

## Complete Workflow Example

### Phase 1: Project Specification (`/specify`)

**Command**: `/specify Build daily customer lifecycle metrics dashboard showing acquisition, retention, and churn trends with data from Salesforce CRM, Stripe billing, and support ticket volumes`

**What Happens**:
1. Creates feature branch: `dashboard/002-build-daily-customer`
2. Generates project structure in `projects/002-build-daily-customer/`
3. Creates specification from data-specific template
4. Sets up task coordination framework

**Generated Files**:
```
projects/002-build-daily-customer/
├── spec.md                    # Business requirements and data definitions
├── tasks/
│   └── current-task.md       # Agent coordination and task status
├── contracts/                # API specs and data contracts (future)
└── findings/                 # Sub-agent analysis outputs (future)
```

**Key Features**:
- **Data-focused specification template** with business context, data sources, and quality requirements
- **Cross-tool integration planning** for dbt, Snowflake, Tableau, Orchestra coordination
- **Structured requirements capture** with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers for ambiguous points
- **Agent coordination setup** for systematic sub-agent handoffs

### Phase 2: Implementation Planning (`/plan`)

**Command**: `/plan Use dbt for transformations, Snowflake for storage, Tableau for visualization, and Orchestra for orchestration. Data sources include Salesforce CRM, Stripe billing, and Freshservice support tickets.`

**What Happens**:
1. Reads project specification and validates requirements
2. Generates technical implementation plan with tool coordination
3. Creates data architecture and cross-system integration specs
4. Validates against data constitution for quality compliance

**Generated Files**:
```
projects/002-build-daily-customer/
├── plan.md                   # Technical implementation plan
├── research.md               # Tool research and technical decisions
├── data-model.md            # Entity definitions and relationships
├── contracts/               # Data contracts between systems
│   ├── dbt-contracts.yml    # dbt model contracts and tests
│   ├── tableau-datasources.yml # Dashboard data source definitions
│   └── snowflake-schema.sql # Database schema and permissions
├── quickstart.md            # Setup and testing instructions
└── CLAUDE.md               # Agent context and coordination instructions
```

**Key Features**:
- **Tool-specific research** for dbt, Snowflake, Tableau, Orchestra capabilities
- **Cross-system architecture planning** with clear integration points
- **Data quality validation** against the data constitution
- **Sub-agent coordination strategy** with handoff specifications

### Phase 3: Task Breakdown (`/tasks`)

**Command**: `/tasks Focus on cross-tool integration testing and sub-agent coordination for staged implementation.`

**What Happens**:
1. Analyzes all available design documents
2. Generates executable tasks with sub-agent assignments
3. Maps task dependencies and parallel execution opportunities
4. Creates detailed handoff instructions for each sub-agent

**Generated Files**:
```
projects/002-build-daily-customer/
└── tasks.md                 # Comprehensive task breakdown with sub-agent assignments
```

**Task Structure Example**:
- **Setup Tasks** (T001-T003): Environment, schemas, permissions
- **Data Foundation Tasks** (T004-T007): [P] Source validation, staging models, optimization
- **Business Logic Tasks** (T008-T011): Intermediate models, marts, dashboards
- **Integration Tasks** (T012-T015): [P] End-to-end testing, performance validation
- **Deployment Tasks** (T016-T018): Production setup, training, go-live

**Key Features**:
- **Sub-agent task assignment** with specific tool expertise (dbt-expert, snowflake-expert, etc.)
- **Parallel execution optimization** marked with [P] for independent tasks
- **Integration point mapping** for cross-tool coordination
- **Systematic validation** across tool boundaries

## Sub-Agent Coordination

### Enhanced Communication Protocol

**Traditional Approach**:
```
Parent → Sub-Agent: "Analyze this dbt issue"
Sub-Agent → Parent: Ad-hoc findings
```

**Spec-Driven Approach**:
```
Parent → Sub-Agent: "Work on project 002-build-daily-customer, Task T008"
Sub-Agent reads: projects/002-build-daily-customer/spec.md
Sub-Agent reads: projects/002-build-daily-customer/plan.md  
Sub-Agent writes: projects/002-build-daily-customer/findings/dbt-findings.md
Sub-Agent updates: projects/002-build-daily-customer/tasks/current-task.md
```

### Cross-Tool Integration Points

The workflow explicitly manages these critical handoffs:
- **dbt → Snowflake**: Schema design and materialization coordination
- **Snowflake → Tableau**: Data source optimization and query performance
- **Orchestra → All Tools**: Pipeline scheduling and monitoring integration
- **Business Context → All**: Stakeholder requirements and validation

### Quality Assurance

**Data Constitution Compliance**:
- Data quality tests before transformation logic (TDD for data)
- Cross-system integration validation
- Performance and scale requirements verification
- Business alignment and stakeholder validation

## Benefits Realized

### 1. Systematic Project Management
- **Numbered project structure** (001-project-name) replaces ad-hoc task management
- **Specification-driven development** ensures business alignment
- **Cross-repository coordination** for complex data pipeline projects

### 2. Enhanced Sub-Agent Coordination
- **Structured handoff protocols** via specification documents
- **Clear task assignments** with specific expertise mapping
- **Integration point management** across tool boundaries

### 3. Improved Quality and Consistency
- **Constitutional compliance** for data governance
- **Test-driven development** adapted for data projects
- **Systematic validation** across the entire data stack

### 4. Better Business Alignment
- **Stakeholder-readable specifications** in natural language
- **Clear success criteria** and acceptance testing
- **Traceability** from business requirements to technical implementation

## Comparison with Traditional Workflow

| Aspect | Traditional da-agent-hub | Enhanced (Spec-Driven) |
|--------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| **Project Initiation** | Ad-hoc TodoWrite tasks | Structured /specify command |
| **Planning** | Implicit coordination | Explicit /plan with cross-tool architecture |
| **Task Management** | Simple task lists | Sophisticated /tasks with sub-agent coordination |
| **Documentation** | Scattered context files | Comprehensive specification documents |
| **Sub-Agent Communication** | `.claude/tasks/` handoffs | Project-based specification handoffs |
| **Quality Assurance** | Manual validation | Constitutional compliance gates |
| **Business Alignment** | Technical focus | Business-requirement driven |

## Getting Started

To use the enhanced workflow:

1. **For Complex Projects**: Use `/specify` → `/plan` → `/tasks` for multi-tool data projects
2. **For Simple Tasks**: Continue using TodoWrite for quick fixes and updates  
3. **Tool Selection**: Let business requirements drive technical approach selection
4. **Sub-Agent Coordination**: Use project-based handoffs for systematic collaboration

The enhanced da-agent-hub maintains backward compatibility while providing powerful new capabilities for complex, cross-tool data analytics projects that require systematic coordination and business alignment.
